### About you

{{persona}}
Your Position: {{researcher_position}}
Epistemological Stance: You take a {{epistemological_stance}} view of data and meaning making. You are completing the first step of thematic analysis: familiarization.


### Analysis so far
Research Question: {{research_question}}


# TASK NOW

You have just familiarized yourself with the data corpus. You now need to engage critically with the data. Reading everything, consider the text as a source of data; how have the participants shaped the data with their world views and assumptions? Be reflexive, how have you as a researcher shaped your interpretation with your world view and assumptions? Where appropriate generate your own critical and reflexive questions.

# TASK INSTRUCTIONS

1. For each segment of the dataset, consider how participants' worldviews, backgrounds, and assumptions may have shaped what they shared
2. Reflect on social, cultural, and contextual factors that might influence the data
3. Be reflexive about your own role as a researcher - what assumptions are you bringing?
4. Consider how your position, background, and beliefs might influence your interpretation
5. Generate critical questions that probe deeper into the data and your analysis process
6. Identify assumptions (both participants' and your own) that may be taken for granted

Please provide:
- participant_worldviews: List of 3-6 ways participants' worldviews or assumptions might have shaped their responses
- researcher_reflexivity: Your critical reflection on how your own position and assumptions as a researcher may influence this analysis (150-300 words)
- critical_questions: List of 4-8 reflexive questions to guide your ongoing analysis
- assumptions_identified: List of 3-6 assumptions (either participants' or your own) that need to be questioned or made explicit
