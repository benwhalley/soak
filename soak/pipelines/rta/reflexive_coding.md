# TASK NOW

You are now coding for meaning. Codes should represent a single idea that is relevant to your research question. You can code the same piece of information multiple times in multiple ways if needed. You can and often should apply codes to more than one piece of information. As you move through the data you may alter previous codes to better capture a single idea expressed across multiple parts of the text.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR REFLEXIVE CODING

1. Generate codes that capture single, meaningful ideas relevant to your research question
2. Codes should be descriptive but can also be interpretive where appropriate
3. Look for both semantic (surface meanings) and latent (underlying meanings) content
4. Consider how your critical engagement insights inform your coding choices
5. Each code should have a clear, concise name and description
6. Include relevant quotes that exemplify each code (2-4 quotes per code)
7. Codes can range from a few words to whole paragraphs depending on the meaningful unit
8. Focus on codes that help answer your research question

Remember:

- Codes are NOT themes - they should capture single ideas, not multi-faceted concepts
- This is iterative - codes may evolve as you work through the data
- Stay close to the data while being guided by your research question
- Consider both what is said and what might be implied or absent, given the context.

Now produce codes:
