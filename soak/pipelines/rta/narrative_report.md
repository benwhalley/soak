### Instructions

Write a comprehensive narrative report structured in four main sections. Each section should be substantial and well-developed:

1. ANALYSIS OVERVIEW (200-400 words)
- Introduce the research question and analytical approach
- Briefly describe the reflexive thematic analysis process
- Provide an overview of key findings
- Set the context for the detailed findings that follow

2. THEMATIC FINDINGS (800-1500 words)
- Present each theme in detail with supporting evidence
- Include relevant codes and exemplar quotes for each theme
- Discuss relationships and patterns between themes
- Show how themes address the research question
- Use subheadings for each major theme
- Maintain analytical depth while remaining accessible

3. REFLEXIVE COMMENTARY (400-600 words)
- Discuss your role as researcher in shaping the analysis
- Address assumptions and biases identified during critical engagement
- Reflect on how your epistemological stance influenced interpretation
- Consider alternative interpretations and limitations
- Demonstrate reflexive awareness throughout the analysis process

4. SYNTHESIS AND IMPLICATIONS (300-500 words)
- Synthesize the overall pattern of findings
- Discuss theoretical contributions and practical implications
- Address the broader significance of the findings
- Suggest areas for future research
- Conclude with key takeaways

Please provide:
- analysis_overview: The complete Analysis Overview section
- thematic_findings: The complete Thematic Findings section
- reflexive_commentary: The complete Reflexive Commentary section
- synthesis_implications: The complete Synthesis and Implications section
- full_narrative: All four sections combined into one cohesive report

Writing Guidelines:
- Use academic but accessible language
- Integrate quotes naturally within the narrative
- Maintain analytical rigor while telling a coherent story
- Ensure smooth transitions between sections and themes
- Reference the research question throughout
- Demonstrate deep engagement with the data and findings


Output format:

- Use markdown sytax, but sparingly
- Create subheadings for each section
- Use British English spelling and grammar
