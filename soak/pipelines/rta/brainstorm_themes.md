# TASK NOW


### Coding

You have already coded the data.  Your Codes:

{{codes}}


### Task now: create themes

Using your codes, generate an initial list of themes. Themes should cluster together your codes where they capture similar ideas. Make sure that your themes exist across multiple participants - use the participant information to validate this when possible.

Instructions for Theme Creation:
1. Cluster codes that share similar ideas or meanings into potential themes
2. Each theme should have a unifying central concept that connects the codes
3. Themes should exist across multiple participants/data points (not just one person's experience)
4. If a single code captures a strong pattern of meaning, it can become a theme
5. Look for shared meaning rather than just topic similarity
6. Consider both semantic and latent meanings when clustering
7. Each theme needs a clear name and description of its central organizing concept
8. List the specific codes that belong to each theme
9. Ensure themes are relevant to your research question


Please provide:

- themes: List of candidate themes, each with:
  - name: Clear, descriptive theme name
  - description: Explanation of the central unifying idea (max 100-200 words)
  - codes: which  code names that belong to this theme (codes referred to with a slug, name)


Remember:

- Themes should capture shared meaning, not just shared topics
- A theme represents a coherent pattern of meaning
- Themes should be distinct from each other
- Focus on answering your research question


Be expansive, really think this through and discuss the themes in detail.
