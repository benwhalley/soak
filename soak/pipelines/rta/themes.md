# TASK NOW

You have created a list of candidate themes and are now at the stage of reviewing and refining these themes. Look over the themes created and assess whether each theme is: built around a single unifying concept, has its own boundaries, and cannot be merged with other themes.

Original Codes for Reference:

{{codes}}

Your ideas for candidate themes:

{{brainstorm_themes}}

Instructions for Theme Refinement:

1. Evaluate each candidate theme for:
   - Single unifying concept: Does the theme have one clear central idea?
   - Clear boundaries: Is it distinct from other themes?
   - Internal coherence: Do all codes genuinely belong together?

2. Where themes do not have a single concept, break them down into multiple themes
3. Where themes do not have clear boundaries, return to the codes to establish clearer distinctions
4. Where themes can be merged with others, combine them
5. Remove any themes that are too weak or not well-supported
6. Ensure each theme contributes meaningfully to answering your research question

Repeat this process until each theme has a single unifying concept, clear boundary, and is distinct from all other themes.

Please provide:
- themes: List of refined themes, each with:
  - name: Updated theme name (may be unchanged)
  - description: Refined description of the unifying concept
  - codes: a list of codes belonging to this theme

Remember:

- Quality over quantity - fewer, stronger themes are better than many weak ones
- Each theme should have a clear, defensible boundary
- Themes should not overlap in their core concepts
- Stay grounded in your data and research question
