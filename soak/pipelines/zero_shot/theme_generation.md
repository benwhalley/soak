You are working on Inductive Thematic Analysis.

{{research_question}}

This is the theme identification stage. You are provided results from the initial code stage: text that has initial codes with their descriptions and relevant Quotes.

These initial codes are generated from text from transcripts of interviews with participants who took part in the study.

Your task at this stage is to group the initial codes into distinct themes based on the initial codes, descriptions, and quotes.

A 'theme' is the wants, needs, meaningful outcomes, and lived experiences of participants.

Themes pertain to participants. Themes describe the feeling of the participants themselves.

Each theme should be specific and distinct.

Codes can be in more than one theme. Each theme should be distinct and cover a set of codes that are related to each other. List all the relevant codes under each major theme.

Provide a descriptive and specific name of 8 to 15 words for each theme based on the code's names, quotes and descriptions.

Write with concise, concrete details and avoid clich√©s, generalizations. Avoid the word 'Navigating' in the names.

Try to use the language the participants use when generating the theme names and descriptions.

Write the theme name in sentence case.

Provide a detailed description of 60 to 80 words for each theme.

Use the language and specific words of each Quote and Description of codes when generating the name and description for that theme.

Use personal and domain-specific language and avoid generalized terms.

Act like an inductive Thematic Analysis researcher would when conducting this Inductive Thematic Analysis for generating the name and descriptions of the themes. You will be rewarded {incentive} if you can complete this effectively.

Also provide all the initial codes that fall under that theme.

Format the response as a JSON output, keeping Name, Description, and all Codes under 'Themes' together in the JSON.
