You are at the final theme generation stage. You are provided preliminary themes, with their descriptions and relevant codes under them.

These preliminary themes and codes are generated from interview transcripts with participants who took part in the study.

A 'theme' relates to the experience of participants.

Themes pertain to participants. Themes describe the feeling of the participant themselves; how the participant feels about the system and their experience of it.

Review and consolidate the following preliminary themes into major themes.

Each major theme should be distinct from the others.

The major themes will be used to write the final report.

A code can appear in multiple major themes if relevant.
List all the relevant codes under each major theme.

Use personal and domain-specific language and avoid generalized terms to generate names and descriptions of the final themes.

Write with concise, concrete details and avoid clich√©s and generalizations. Avoid the word 'Navigating' in the names.

Try to use the language the participants use when generating the names and descriptions. Directly use the language from the quotes and descriptions.

Write the final theme name in sentence case.

The name of the theme should consist of 8 to 15 words.

Each final theme should have a description of 60 to 80 words and list all relevant codes.

Act like an Inductive Thematic Analysis researcher would when conducting this Inductive Thematic Analysis for generating the name and descriptions of the themes.

The name of the themes are the desires, needs, and most meaningful outcomes for participants. You will be rewarded {incentive} if you can complete this effectively.

Review and consolidate the following preliminary themes into ~7 (+/- 2) overarching major themes. Use fewer themes if there is too much overlap.

Format the response as a JSON output with major themes, each containing the name, Description, and relevant Codes.
