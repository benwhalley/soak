such an incredible interview for you today this is a really special one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for

there can be such a crazy mix of symptoms coming at you when you have chronic fatigue syndrome or mecfs things such as problems with memory or concentration sore throat headaches enlarged lymph nodes muscle pain joint pain unrefreshing sleep debilitating fatigue nausea food intolerances post exertional malaise dizziness digestive issues allergies sensitivities to light sound smells and chemicals irregular heartbeat shortness of breath just to name a few and with mecfs whether these symptoms come on suddenly or slowly creep up over time this onslaught of new symptoms can be overwhelming and confusing and scary and we live in a world that has pretty much taught us to treat our unwell body like a broken down car so your car is not running like it should you might need a new battery or alternator or a new fan or belt of some sort we're told that our body like our car has a bunch of separate parts and when we are unwell we are to focus on each part in our body separately and fix each part individually so when we find ourselves facing this nightmarish illness known as mecfs we naturally might set off and try and tackle these symptoms that we are seeing in our bodies and fix them each one by one so of course we're overwhelmed and confused where does one even start so in an attempt to tackle this topic i've invited my good friends liz carlson and pamela rose who like me have lived with and fully recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome or mecfs to join me in a conversation about the potential role and value of focus on symptoms and comparing our symptoms with others i think most of us during our lives are brought up and conditioned and taught to focus on symptoms probably one because we don't have that many because we're generally healthy hopefully and two just because this is kind of how society seems to be wired so you have a symptom you focus on it you google the heck out of it you get yourself all worried about it you talk to other people you see if anyone else is facing something similar you go to the doctor you see how to fix that symptom and what you need to do to treat it in my experience with mecfs this never really got me anywhere because this illness can express itself in so many different ways and for me recovery ended up being not about focusing on symptoms and treating specific symptoms but on supporting my body as a whole i definitely did do some symptom management along the way and it was more of a means to an end or a way to keep myself comfortable during the process of recovery but targeting the specific symptoms was never healing them in my experience so if i had pain i might take painkillers or if i was having really bad problems with sleeping and i was trying everything under the sun and nothing would work i might go see my doctor and get some prescription sedatives so the symptom management that i did was more palliative and not so much about recovery now i'm certainly not advocating that symptoms in our bodies should be ignored i think we do need to pay attention to them of course go to our doctors get the tests done necessary to see what's going on if it's anything that we should be concerned about or if this is just part of our lovely mecfs package but i've definitely found that once we have assessed that these symptoms aren't a sign of something else that it's just part of mecfs that putting too much concentration on them isn't really helpful\n\nSPEAKER_01: honest moment so after sharing my full recovery story from mecfs i get a lot of great supportive messages but i also get asked to compare my own symptoms triggers and challenges with others sometimes the exact levels and if i have fixes right now\n\nSPEAKER_01: i'm here to tell you why symptom comparison and stop the symptom thinking isn't actually helpful to healing and i totally understand i was once in your shoes so i think i can bring an interesting perspective to this because i help people manage conditions like mecfs every day and yes something that people are always keen to talk about is my story when they hear that i've been there and i fully recovered from me cfs they really want to know what helped me and of course they do and i remember what it's like i remember how desperate i was to find the thing that was going to fix me i spent thousands of hours googling my symptoms to find other people with those symptoms and what pathogens they could be or what organ can be affected so i can then take herbs or find supplements to fix those symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_01: this led me to spend thousands of dollars this led me to buy tree bark shipped directly from africa this led me to almost poisoning myself by buying organic elderberries from oregon and eating them not realizing you're supposed to sip them in a tea this led me to many doctor's appointments trying to figure out what was broken with me it led me to many forms trying to compare my viral levels with other people's viral levels and then seeing what prescription antivirals they took and if they said i took them but they didn't really help me much i'd be like well they helped you some i need to get those but you know what i crash anyway well the supplements did help me get by paralegal enough to walk two blocks to my grocery store and back i needed a more comprehensive strategy to actually heal that didn't involve just trying to stop all my symptoms one by one\n\nSPEAKER_00: now that i've recovered and i'm sharing my story i get quite a few people reaching out to me and telling me a bit of their stories and about what their experience has been which is really incredible i love connecting with so many people in this way i think it's a really amazing thing one common theme that i see is that quite a few people want to compare their symptoms against mine they want to see i have this did you have this happening or i have that or can you tell me what symptoms you had for this and i think this happens for a couple of very understandable reasons i think the first reason that this is happening that i suspect is that people want to see if we're the same if my symptoms match your symptoms and i recovered then that means that there's good hope that you can recover but if my symptoms are different you might assess that that means oh that that means that you can't recover\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i just was seeking reassurance you know my symptoms worse than other people's are they bad good what helped one person is that going to help me and what i absolutely know now from helping schools of people is that what can be hugely helpful for one person can make lots of just a difference for somebody else unfortunately\n\nSPEAKER_00: and the second reason i suspect this is happening is because people want to treat their specific symptoms so if i had a specific symptom that they had they want to know what i did to get rid of it\n\nSPEAKER_01: another reason people reach out to people who've recovered trying to compare symptoms is because they want them to tell them what to do and that's not honestly how i healed i had to look in the mirror and say liz i'm going to save you and you know i did have coaches who are so helpful to me at the end of the day i had to call the shots and trust my own intuition\n\nSPEAKER_00: so both of these things are very understandable but i think both of them can also be problematic and i think this can be problematic because this illness can express itself in so many different ways if someone is sizing up their illness against my illness and it doesn't match exactly and then from that what they take away is that they do not have a chance of recovering obviously that's a really dangerous mindset to get into many different illnesses can express themselves in many different ways and it does not mean that it's not the same thing and the second way that it's if not problematic just not helpful is because if people want to know about my specific symptoms and how i treated them i didn't actually treat them specifically so i just really have nothing to offer people who want to know how i handle different symptoms and i suspect that the response that i give them is not very satisfying usually along the lines of yeah i generally pulled myself out of this illness by treating my body in a holistic manner and as i slowly improved overall my symptoms slowly decreased until they were eventually gone which in the moment if you've got one really annoying or frustrating or difficult symptom that you're trying to get rid of is probably frustrating to hear\n\nSPEAKER_01: another reason you might want to compare your symptoms with someone else who is healed is because you're worried that your symptoms are so numerous so scary so crazy and you want reassurance that it's still possible for you too to heal and i just want to say yes it is possible for you to heal no matter how random crazy or numerous your symptoms no matter the levels and while i list many symptoms on my website and in my interview with raylan i shared some as well there's tons of i don't mention but it's because listing every single symptom isn't going to help you get out at the end of the day the symptoms aren't the issue the symptoms are just your body's manifestation of disease i would encourage people to yes do some reading online maybe research some things purely from a point of view of it being reassuring and inspiring but don't get too caught up on comparing symptoms scanning information for what were their test results what were the particular blood levels they had for certain things what really helped them it probably won't help you personally just use that to inspire you to perhaps give you some ideas but don't get too carried away don't compare\n\nSPEAKER_01: your symptoms with somebody else's your test results with somebody else's test results stay true to what's going to work for you certainly when it comes to test results knowing what somebody's blood reports were doesn't really impact or have any correlation to what yours were because it depends what your starting point was what's normal for you you know i promised that if i ever got out of the health hole that is mecfs i would share my story to help inspire others but what i didn't sign up for was to troubleshoot people's symptoms one on one\n\nSPEAKER_01: i actually know quite a few people who recovered who share their story and then got overwhelmed by all the messages and then they left social media because it was just too much and i myself am an empathetic person but i'm also a person who now has boundaries and one of my boundaries is not talking about my old symptoms with other people and also not talking about their symptoms with them either\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i love hearing positive messages and getting feedback of what people might want to hear but i choose not to talk about symptoms one on one even writing my own story on my blog honestly took me forever because it's pretty traumatizing going back there i mean i look at it now and just words on a page but\n\nSPEAKER_01: this was the worst thing that ever happened to me and\n\nSPEAKER_01: if you're there you know that so consider that the people who share their stories are still human and it might still be fresh their challenges on their journey another thing i just want to touch on is the fact that i'm really not a fan of labels i get people coming to me especially at the moment with people who have got long covid as we call it in the uk post covid fatigue and they want to know have i still got post viral fatigue or is this mecfs you know i'm not a huge fan of labels because to be honest it doesn't change doesn't change anything what it's called doesn't suddenly change how you're feeling or how long you've had it or how long it's going to take you to recover the important thing is you are doing something about it so although there are a couple of instances where perhaps it's useful to have a label like if you really are in the deep sort of chronic end of the extreme fatigue scale and you need to get signed off work and those sorts of things from a practicality point of view can be useful but on the whole labels don't make a difference and comparing your symptoms to somebody else's and are yours worse or better than theirs again that's something that i really encourage people not to get too caught up in i'm a big believer that if the severity of the symptoms that you are experiencing is enough to change your life to a certain extent then that's severe for you it doesn't matter how it compares to somebody else's life it's all about your journey through and i guess that's the point i keep coming back to today is make this personal to you build your recovery plan for you and i hope that this has been helpful i want you to look at your own life like a scientist without freaking out about everything yeah i hope that made sense to you and sending you my support along your healing journey you've got this so my key message to everybody watching this is look at your own personal journey through this don't compare your results to somebody else's because your starting points would be different your whole makeup will be different there are so many different factors that can\n\nSPEAKER_01: play a part in that and the one thing that i think all three of us absolutely agree on is that everybody's experience of living with mecfs is different not only because how long you've been on that journey might differ the severity of your symptoms what your symptoms are indeed but because of our individual lifestyles so just like pacing has to be tailored individually for a particular person because their life is so different i truly believe somebody's recovery plan and them selecting the things they want to try\n\nSPEAKER_01: needs to be tailored as well\n\nSPEAKER_00: so what do you guys think do you find it helpful to pay a lot of attention to your specific symptoms or are you also having the experience of recovery being a more holistic process are there times when you find it helpful to compare with other people you've heard our thoughts it's just three of us we'd love to hear yours as always this is how we learn this is how we grow this is how we get past this so let's keep the conversation going in the comments because we'd love to hear your feedback and your experience with all of this and a huge thank you to liz and pamela for taking part in this i very much appreciate having your contributions to this and i'm sure everyone else does as well and if you enjoyed this video you might like this video right here on the screen where i review some of the latest research coming out of harvard that helps us better understand mecfs so take care everyone sending love to you all i hope you're doing well thank you for watching and i'll see you again

hello everyone i am really excited today we have katie gardner joining us she is in buffalo new york katie is an licensed occupational therapist and she is here today because she is going to be sharing some of her journey with chronic illness which includes diagnosis for chronic fatigue syndrome as well as some other things i'll let her go into details of that but i'm just really excited to have you here welcome katie thank you for having me i'm so excited to meet with you and to be here i am really excited to hear more about your story and i'm so grateful and beyond impressed that you are willing and able to do this right now because i hope you don't mind my sharing but katie is thirty eight weeks pregnant as we speak\n\nSPEAKER_00: hopefully not during this interview but that would add some excitement\n\nSPEAKER_00: well you're a trooper thanks for doing us i hope your week goes well you induced on your wednesday getting induced on wednesday so very exciting your world is about to get even crazier\n\nSPEAKER_00: i'm excited that's the thing like life opened up and once we got better you know everyone must be feeling this like i got a second chance at life\n\nSPEAKER_00: everything i just like i don't even know because i couldn't even picture my future before i think it was too hard to dream or hope and now it's like who knows what will happen it's just amazing if i'm having even the slightest bad day i catch these moments and i have to catch myself and be like you are a walking miracle like this is incredible you are living something that you dreamed about every day for years like your life is a dream whatever it is that's stressing you out does not matter it does not matter yeah absolutely and it's it's funny that's one of my prayers is may i never forget may i never forget and become\n\nSPEAKER_00: no offense but like a normal person\n\nSPEAKER_00: who takes it for granted i never forget because that joy is so enlivening and it's like every day it's like you're winning the race every day you're like yes\n\nSPEAKER_00: it's like being like when you watch a six year old wandering through the world and they're just like a flower a tree a puppy\n\nSPEAKER_00: these new eyes where you just get to almost be childlike again and just really appreciate things so much so yeah i hope it doesn't go away yeah i don't think i don't think it will but it's something i do think about often\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think i'll appreciate this it is hard though to have friends who've never been through it like most of my friends have obviously never been through it and they complain about their lives and i just feel such a detachment sometimes it is hard\n\nSPEAKER_00: as much as it probably was hard for them to be my friend through it sometimes it's hard for me to be their friend now because i'm like you have it all\n\nSPEAKER_00: i really struggle with people who probably we all have our triggers but people who seem physically able to go to the gym but just choose not to\n\nSPEAKER_00: it was the worst for me when i was sick like i would give anything to because i love working out so that's one of my things that i really miss so when i can see people who could and just did it of course i don't know their life and i don't know what they're facing and they've got their own reasons and limitations i have no clue what's going on in their world but yes i know i know exactly what you mean i felt that way about people who complain about work and i'm like that's all i want to be able to do like i was my life and my identity but yeah you're right you know people are entitled to complain about their lives yeah their problems are real\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does change things so it is nice to just connect with other people who kind of had this experience just before we dive in as i always say i'm not a medical professional katie is an occupational therapist so she is a medical professional but neither one of us are for sure your medical professionals at the moment so we're just sharing our own personal experience of living with and recovering from chronic illness so certainly nothing of what we share should be considered medical advice my story actually begins in childhood actually because i did have some major infection that impacted my ability to go to school and i was in the hospital no one knew really was wrong and the reason bring that up it's because it's relevant to later it was constant fungal infections in my stomach intestines and the doctor find it a lot of times couldn't treat it it's believed that some of that stuff may have triggered my genetic condition i did recover from that so i knew healing was possible and it wasn't until twenty fourteen that i actually started experience chronic fatigue symptoms where i couldn't walk i just wasn't recovering sleep so i would be working for about every i don't know two to four months and then i would end up collapsing and i just couldn't recover fully so anytime i did a strenuous task i would have that sort of\n\nSPEAKER_00: price to pay so to speak so that's when i knew something was more serious and started to investigate it and try to heal so what happened when you initially went to the doctors what did they say i was initially diagnosed with fibromyalgia they completely ignored the ability that i was having a hard time moving against gravity and fatigued they really missed the fatigue so it took a while before i even got the chronic fatigue diagnosis but no one would even really treat it i don't think they really what to do they looked at just blood work ology it just really i wasn't really getting care for it for many years yeah unfortunately such a common story i'm sure you've seen as well it seems to be the same for so many of us in the beginning not a lot of answers not a lot of help so what did you do well i kept rehabilitate myself being an occupational therapist and leaving that possible because childhood experience i just\n\nSPEAKER_00: researching doctors researching as much as i could and then eventually i moved from new york city back home to buffalo and that's where i got linked with some really great doctors first an integrated nurse practitioner\n\nSPEAKER_00: level of investigative blood work that i was not used to i call her the blood detective she was looking at underlying infections candida epstein barr virus real infections and she went out helped me to go after that and for a while that actually made me worse it was pretty brutal treatment she would try to build my body up but at the same time it was getting down these infections i could for some reason never my body just couldn't fight and that was the missing link why couldn't my body fight these infections other people have epstein barr virus and they recover what was it about my body that was the missing link that's what brought me to my other doctor who's an immunologist and probably the most brilliant man i know and he started looking at genetic conditions that have to do with metabolic myopathies and mitochondrial dysfunction and what direction did he suggest going for that or what where did you take it from there so i had full genetic or full genome testing done and i did find that i have mitochondrial disease called mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome eleven and when i read about it it was like tears down my face because it's like targets the diaphragm i was like this is it finally and he put me on the cocktail which helped basically my body wasn't producing mitochondria i could never fight infections my body strength to fight so by him supplementing and boosting my mitochondria i could now fight the infections that i was trying for probably like a year and a half prior and when you came together it was like\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow before you got this what were your days like or what were your weeks like oh my goodness i was working on a master's degree which you know is a lot it's a lot of work there full days i was doing clinical rotations i had friends i went out almost every night of the week i don't even know how i didn't look good in school i love to socialize i love to go out i traveled i lived in colorado i lived in philadelphia new york city i'm sure everyone was shocked when i got just not something that anyone probably could have predicted or coming wasn't at all like my childhood experience it's completely different yeah it sounds like it came on pretty suddenly it seems like that but when i look back i think that there were some signs that i was stressed i had been in graduate school i'd been in a stressful relationship a toxic relationship i was just probably overworking myself i was living in new york city working very long hours i was a traveling therapist at one point so i was walking i was working ten hour days walking from one end of manhattan to the other end of manhattan i'm warning signs i wasn't necessarily the healthiest person\n\nSPEAKER_00: so many things it just really seems like so many of us have so much of the same you know it seems like it comes on suddenly but when we look back we see we have pretty much i mean i'm sure it's not everybody but i imagine you've noticed the same really pushing it not taking such good care of ourselves but on the surface we look so vibrant so healthy we're always on the go we might be working out a lot you know just very social happy looking people so you went from obviously being very active you know very engaged in life when you got sick what did that look like what did your days and your weeks look like after that for those for that first year however long before you started getting the help that you needed the first year was kind of basically me living in denial i would continue to try to work and people would pull me aside like this is dangerous\n\nSPEAKER_00: because i was also working with patients i was i was scared i rob people i was scared i hurt people i felt an ethical responsibility it just wasn't safe i didn't feel safe riding the subway home because i thought i'd fall asleep or pass out and wake up and not know but it was very difficult to do grocery shopping so i just kept trying and then\n\nSPEAKER_00: it took me a while to realize that this was serious and that it needed a full time job so eventually you had to quit your job and focus on getting your health back what are some other things that have contributed to your recovery i would say lifestyle modification i had to dramatically change my diet through i had to do basically an elimination diet first to figure out what was causing basically use food as medicine as a mindset of healing and then i also had to really work on rehab through movement and for me that's really important because i can't get my cells oxygen if i'm not so i know movement is a very hot topic and it is very controversial because it's not done properly but i had to\n\nSPEAKER_00: gradually increase my ability to\n\nSPEAKER_00: and then also i removed all toxic ingredients immunotoxic i\n\nSPEAKER_00: water filtration system on my house i just the lengths which i went to and it really helped my so you mentioned diet played a big role and it seems that a lot of us find this and i'm curious what diet changes ended up helping for you not because i think necessarily it's the key for anyone else but i think it's good for people to see that there are different paths to health through diet for people and it is very much individual so i'm curious for you what ended up being your what did your body respond to well the three main offenders that were pretty obvious before i even did the elimination diet were dairy gluten and sugar and then from there i tried many different diets i did find for me i needed a high protein meat based diet i don't know if that's\n\nSPEAKER_00: mitochondrial disease but when i tried vegetarian i had a hard time with beans i had a hard time with soy and so i struggled with some of those components of it so i found that some nightshades bother me i don't know if i'm familiar with nightshades but i did have a problem with those for a while nightshades that's things like what is that is that tomatoes and bell peppers or what is yes it's tomato potatoes eggplant the one i can't take i can't tolerate anymore i can't see the funny thing when i did the elimination diet and i gave my body a break to heal i slowly could incorporate those things back in without being as inflamed over time so it's kind of scary at first you're like what am i going to have left but eggs were bothering me for a while they don't bother me\n\nSPEAKER_00: just took some things out for a while gave my body that chance to heal and slowly would incorporate them and sometimes they did offend me still and sometimes they did well that's encouraging that you didn't have to cut everything out forever because that is a bit of a scary prognosis to look at for your life like how eating is just going to be stressful forever it was stressful and it's very hard to do i did it as a last resort after years of suffering it wasn't my first\n\nSPEAKER_00: trying to do that it is very hard\n\nSPEAKER_00: from my husband and my mom and help because i was honestly too sick to cook for myself and with those types of restrictions it's just hard to meal plan hard to it's a hard process and for me it also required i think i hear you saying the same thing but just a level of desperation because it is hard but you get to a point where you're so desperate you just need you'll do just about anything to get your health back so all of a sudden what felt unthinkable is suddenly doable and another thing that helped me because for a while i tried really hard to get my diet in order but i would cheat and fall off and then come back to it before i really got serious as time rolled on and i could see that i wasn't getting my life back i was going to have to get more serious but another thing sugar we all mentioned seem to mention sugar and sugar was a massive one for me and sugar was a tough one for me not just because i liked it and i didn't want to get rid of it because i clearly had a physical addiction it was intense i would get up in the middle of the night every single night and eat sugar like there was something happening i would sometimes take a spoon\n\nSPEAKER_01: and eat it right out of the\n\nSPEAKER_00: canister like it was insane so for me it was healing my gut getting more probiotics and i always thought it was a willpower thing i was just weak and i just why can't i stop i know this is bad for me but once my body started healing the cravings went away i think the desperation combined with the body starting to heal and get a bit more imbalance so those cravings go away and it all becomes a bit more doable it does become a bit more doable it's really hard at first and i had i have memories of being a little kid and like going in the corner and like eating treats like nonstop and bread i was obsessed with\n\nSPEAKER_00: eating that infection and there was some sort of addiction there and i mean it's very it's very hard to fight fight that but once i got broke through you're right i didn't feel those cravings the same way and doesn't it just feel like freedom i thought i was going to have to face this the rest of my life i thought my whole life was going to be a battle with food because it really was before i got sick and it's just incredible to have this healthy relationship with food where it's not a battle and you're not trying to force yourself to eat the right things okay so i just want to make sure i'm catching all of this so for you the main things\n\nSPEAKER_00: could you summarize for us what were the main things that worked for you for your recovery the main things that worked there's something\n\nSPEAKER_00: i did have to go back and heal trauma i had to do some spiritual healing so some mind body work i had to modify my diet i had to create some sort of movement routine that worked for my body that i could tolerate and not decline with and i had to remove all environmental toxins yeah it sounds very similar to my journey as well and i think it's good using the word movement and this was one of the mistakes i think when i talk about my recovery journey as i call it exercise and when people hear exercise they picture at the gym or going for a run but when i'm talking about my exercise program it was so small you know it was one to two minutes a day and in the beginning not even every single day and it was just really gentle movement because i think you're right it is definitely a sensitive topic and with good reason because full blown exercise can put people in the hospital even just three or four minutes of it and wrapping your head around i gotta get this lymph moving to reduce i have to put i have to and i have to get oxygen and nutrients to my cells and that happens through movement\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it's confusing because we're trying to get in sync with our body and listen to our body which is part of this journey but a big part of the message is our body is telling us some of the time it's just don't move but i found i couldn't rest my way out of this i couldn't just lay in bed or lay on the couch all day i was never going to get better i tried that for a long time and it didn't get me anywhere i agree i did the same thing so it's great there are so many things that did work for you were there some things that you tried that didn't work for you and what were they\n\nSPEAKER_00: that doesn't work chasing symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_00: i was in pain for a long time whether it was taking this pill taking this supplement everyone always wants to know what supplements i'm on and i'm going to real honest the supplements i take are based on my blood work and my genetic profile they're not necessarily applicable to else it doesn't\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i don't think supplements are the cure clearly the supplements i take are supporting metabolic disease i have where my body\n\nSPEAKER_00: so idea that there's going to be a quick\n\nSPEAKER_00: pill just chasing symptoms i mean you do need symptoms and it's one of the best things i ever did\n\nSPEAKER_00: one of the best things you did was go off coffee\n\nSPEAKER_00: hormonally helped rebalance my hormones healed my gut and also i have such good energy throughout the day it just it was it was shooting up my cortisol too much and rocking my just my adrenals so it made it made a big impact but for a while i was like quick fix like this\n\nSPEAKER_00: it seems like almost cruel advice for someone with chronic fatigue syndrome to say to stop having coffee what do you mean it's just the only thing that makes me feel better but it makes me feel better at least for me in the moment but it put me on such a roller coaster it messed up my blood sugar in time came to realize that big part of my afternoon crashes was just the caffeine crash and it's not a regular person caffeine crash with cfs it seems to be amplified it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah and it's a good point about the symptoms too i think we're all kind of brought up to chase symptoms you know we treat things one at a time we look at our body like a car you know fix little parts individually and i agree i think it's a balance you do have to treat some of them you know like for me i wasn't sleeping and i did all the things under the sun that you're supposed to do and it just wasn't working so for a while i had to take some you know prescription sedatives and like you had i had to target some symptoms individually but in the end what seems to pull its weight is looking at things in a more holistic viewpoint i agree and i had insomnia too and i had to take medication and i'm not against that but i'm talking about yeah overall healing yeah yeah when people ask things like you know what supplement should i take for brain fog or what should i do for you know whatever pain in my body and it's it's really hard i can't break any of it most of it down there wasn't specific things i did that worked for specific symptoms it was just slowly pulling my body out of all of it so i actually get some people messaging me or commenting on videos that are wanting to get pregnant or thinking about having a child and that actually naturally brings up a lot of stuff for them i don't have any children so i don't have anything to offer on this but i'm curious for you what has this process been like this pregnancy with your history of illness\n\nSPEAKER_00: well if you told me two years ago that i'd be pregnant i would have thought that that's crazy\n\nSPEAKER_00: like i was literally almost on my deathbed two years ago i could never have imagined this future i could have never imagined well enough because i didn't want to be a burden more of a burden to my husband i didn't want the financial responsibility i didn't think i could be a good mom i didn't want to\n\nSPEAKER_00: with that watch that so it was not even thought about and then when i got better so quickly heal and heal from endometriosis all these other things i was like well i kind of i have a good relationship with god right i was like well what's next what do you want from me and i did feel i gave my life over so i realized that was the one area i was holding back because i was still i didn't want to live in fear\n\nSPEAKER_00: because there's not a lot of research out there doctors couldn't make any promises to me\n\nSPEAKER_00: you'll be fine and i'm like\n\nSPEAKER_00: pregnant and so that set me on a course of learning how to give up control in a whole nother way and\n\nSPEAKER_00: it has been quite a journey i mean i keep reminding myself these are normal symptoms it does triggering it's triggering sometimes to be like is this normal fatigue or is this going back and you know are these headaches are they going to turn into migraines again you know but i keep reminding myself no it's normal to have headaches when you're pregnant it's normal to feel tired\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know and so i think in a way this experience is healing in itself because it's reminding me that i\n\nSPEAKER_00: do that our bodies are more amazing than we think that they are\n\nSPEAKER_00: and so it's been definitely an interesting experience yeah i can only imagine it's something that i experience even not being pregnant i imagine it's something we all experience to a certain extent we're just a bit i don't want to say paranoid but we've been through a lot so it's natural to question all these things and to get scared and have anxiety and is it coming back is this normal i thought i was better and it's a constant reminder i have to have for myself that getting better doesn't mean perfection nobody is nobody is perfect\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i mean normal healthy people get headaches healthy people have bad days and so i try to draw that line somewhere but you know i did get gestational diabetes with this pregnancy and i remind myself two of my husband's coworkers have gestate had gestation like but it's so hard when we are so used to our own trauma from this experience to not think oh no like something and probably go easy on ourselves for having those thoughts it's it's natural i think anyone's going to and i would hope and i would imagine that as time passes we'll get more and more comfortable with this and more used to just the regular ups and downs of life this has clearly been a massive ordeal that you've been through i always love knowing you know how this has changed you how it's impacted your life oh yeah i mean total different direction i thought i was going to have this full time career\n\nSPEAKER_00: occupational therapy and how i saw my identity how i valued myself was on my achievements and that was taken away and i had to realize that my value was deeper than that and people love me people want to help me i could learn to accept that\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i humbled me changed me i maybe was prideful before i wouldn't say i had a spirituality before relationship with god and it took me getting so sick and so desperate and exhausting all my options\n\nSPEAKER_00: willing to pray like the simplest thing which is free you're spending thousands and thousands on all these treatments and all these things and that changed me i never be the person i was before and i'm thankful for that appreciate life more i don't know quite how to put this but it's a bit of a conflicted relationship isn't it with illness because i think it really does bring a lot of good and it really changes us and it really catapults our growth and puts us in a better direction a lot of us anyways so you know it's something that is so horrible and so horrendous and you wouldn't wish on anybody but at the same time it's hard to imagine your life what it would be like if it hadn't gone that way it is really hard to describe what suffering does i mean this sometimes feels like i was in prison physically and then i'm set free trying to teach i only get one i only get one life\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is this life experience trying to teach me while i'm here how can i get the most out\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it is a perspective and an attitude too i mean you can choose to take things away from it or not it's happening either way there's no taking it away there's no choosing a life without it so we can either use it to shape us into someone better than we were before or not it sounds like you've definitely definitely gotten a lot out of this so good for you for doing all of this work and coming out of this in such a good place thank you it's exciting to see that in other people i love that i love hearing other people\n\nSPEAKER_00: it really is and there really are so many people that are getting past these things and i just i don't think we see enough of it it can be so discouraging to look online and see the prognosis for some of these illnesses but there are so many people who are getting better at various stages of recovery there's so much reason to be hopeful and i love that there's more and more stories like yours coming out and thank you so much for sharing yours because it just it makes a world of difference you know i remember when i first got sick i was trying to find recovery stories and i just couldn't find any this was twelve years ago or something i didn't hear of anyone getting better until i had gotten better\n\nSPEAKER_00: and then people other people start reaching out to me it's crazy we're just so shocked like hey so nice to meet you you recovered as well this is incredible\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it's just really nice it's really nice to see so if you could go back in time to when this first all happened i'm curious what you would tell yourself what would you have wanted to know at the beginning that you think could have helped you navigate this or at least been better prepared for what was to come i guess what we just said i think\n\nSPEAKER_00: that there are other people out there that have gotten better if i own that in the beginning i don't know my motivation i mean i was pretty motivated but man just knowing that would have just i was so defeated from day one when a doctor told me your life is over when i was first diagnosed fibromyalgia and they said this is it your life is over this is forever and i didn't want to believe that part of me rejected it but you can't unhear it so it messed with my mind and if i know no that's not true you can't limit a person's potential you don't know everything about chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia so how can you possibly have answers and for me now my faith it's like you cannot limit a limitless guy so i guess i would just tell myself to trust that process because i think i did have to go through all those years of research and learning i couldn't just skip ahead\n\nSPEAKER_00: to know what i know now i mean that took years that took years it was like going to getting a bachelor's degree and chronic illness so i don't know if there's\n\nSPEAKER_00: quick way through that of learning your body and learning what works specifically for you\n\nSPEAKER_00: but i guess i would just tell myself that it is very very possible\n\nSPEAKER_00: so perfectly put i've never heard that before like getting a bachelor's degree in chronic illness that is pretty much what all of us have to do i worked way harder at this recovery than any of my actual degrees you know you had to learn so much i think that is the most important point about the hope and not just hope but knowledge that people do get past it because that's it's the really the biggest part of the fuel because this is such a marathon it really is it's really hard it's exhausting it's a lot of work it's boring it's lonely it's stressful it's depressing and if you don't even know that it's actually possible i think most of us hold on to this deep hope within us like i will get past this i am determined but when you don't even know if it's possible most really bad days or weeks or months it's really hard to keep picking yourself back up important\n\nSPEAKER_00: to know watching people do get better we don't know you know what everyone's prognosis is and we don't know what everyone's journey is going to be so you obviously can't say for certain what's going to happen for everybody but i think exactly as you said we cannot put limits on it no one can put limits on your recovery thank you so much katie for sharing your story today it really is incredibly moving you know i've had goosebumps you brought me to tears it's just really wonderful how far you've come and it's so amazing to see you living this amazing life and happy and thriving and about to have your baby very soon so just thank you so much for sharing this with us today for asking me to do it it's my pleasure i love it i love what you're doing i'm so happy i got to meet liz and i've gotten to meet oh my goodness so many people it's i literally when i think about like us being in a room i probably would just cry\n\nSPEAKER_00: and like i would just high five people and hug people and cry and we survived we did it how amazing would that be i just it's just so i think about somebody i can picture somebody and they're bad just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i mean this would have been mind blowing to me to have i would have been like what and it's funny i don't i don't know if you get these types of messages too but people will be like how do you know you really had chronic fatigue\n\nSPEAKER_00: they can't wrap their head around someone could feel because they've been told so many times\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i'm like that's why the more pictures we can show them of people so it's not just me saying it a whole group of people stepping forward that it's like undeniable evidence yeah i definitely get that too you know that comments or people sort of like oh i'm not sure you ever really had it or you probably clearly you weren't all that sick or that doesn't actually work for chronic fatigue syndrome because no one can get better from that or most people aren't like that most people you know are there's a lot of positivity out there but you can understand the people who are jaded who are skeptical and they just can't wrap their head around it no this can't be you're not like me we're not the same that's not possible i don't know what's happening there but that's not it so i try not to be like defensive i'm like whatever i know my life like i don't have anything to prove that's such a good attitude to have and that's such a good way to look at it because i find it is easy to get defensive because sometimes it can feel like an attack and feel like you have to defend your illness which is not helping anything or anyone if people want to find you if they want to ask you questions or know more about you where can they find you i'm on instagram my handle is healing faithfully one word and i have a site where i share more details about my story and healing aspects it's

hey guys if you're struggling with the overwhelming challenges of chronic fatigue please know that you're not alone and what's even more important is to know that there is a way out many people have recovered from this and are now thriving hi everyone i'm raylan if you're new here welcome on this channel we share insights knowledge and resources that we have learned to be helpful with conditions like mecfs and long covid so how do we know these things we've learned it from the more than a hundred and fifty recorded recovery interviews right here on the channel i'm excited to have frances goodall with us today all the way over in sheffield in the uk francis has an incredible story of overcoming mecfs and has used her knowledge to help others to also return to living fully like she does today as a working mom and an outdoor enthusiast who has even completed three half marathons so let's dive right in and welcome francis francis so amazing to have you here thank you for doing this today oh thank you for having me on your wonderful channel so take us back what was happening around the time when you first became unwell\n\nSPEAKER_00: so when i first became unwell i was quite young i was only nineteen i was at university and i was doing all of the things you know i had a job i was studying hard i joined all the different societies i possibly could join and you know developed a new friendship group and was going out a lot and then suddenly one day i was on my way to do some voluntary work and i just yeah just didn't feel well at all didn't know what was going on felt a bit fluy felt a bit strange felt a bit scared because it felt really weird and then yeah that was the start of it really i ended up not being able to continue my university studies ended up having to come back home and live with my mom and i think it probably took about six i think it took six months to get a chronic fatigue or me diagnosis\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah you can tell when someone went through this a while ago you know it wasn't last year the year before because i feel like we developed this ability to just zoom through that one of the most intense experiences of our life like yeah so i became unwell and then i had to drop on a university\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know that had to be a really scary thing at such a young age you know when you got started not feeling well and didn't get better what were you thinking\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i was well i also got i had a doctor wanted to diagnose me as being depressed not being the main issue as well like very early on but i knew it wasn't just depression i knew there was emotion about feeling unwell and you know i was emotionally challenged by that was probably getting depressed by that but i knew there was something else going on so yeah it was really scary time definitely a time that i feel like i've grieved and worked with as i healed you know at the other end which is probably why i can talk about it so lightly now but yeah at the time it was really really scary and i didn't know what was happening i didn't know what to do yeah and at first i kind of gave up it i went home and was kind of even doing things like watching daytime television and just feeling a bit low and you know all my friends from home had gone to university all my friends from university were still at university so initially i didn't really have anyone there other than my family and yeah it was a very tough time\n\nSPEAKER_01: so doctors told you that the cause of all this was depression\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah one of the first doctors said she just thought i was depressed that was it\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i think a lot of us hear that and it's i think a little bit infuriating i can see how they come to that conclusion because we likely are depressed but that wasn't for most of us the first thing takeaway pitch that was ability to function in the world and anyone's going to be depressed yeah so what did you do did you just start googling or how did you start to try and figure your way out of this\n\nSPEAKER_00: in the year before i got ill i had also traveled the world before going to university and i had got really interested in meditation and buddhism and yoga a little bit as well so i thought i did think quite early on well perhaps meditation and yoga can help me heal so i did start quite early on doing a little bit of meditation yoga a little bit of breath work like for instance i remember one time doing the alternate nostril breathing and noticing i felt different after doing it so or doing a relaxation oh yeah i often listen to relaxations as well guided relaxations and then doing them sometimes i'd notice i felt considerably better after doing one so that those sorts of experiences quite early on gave me some hope that there was something i could do about getting myself better but often it was just like feeling better for a little bit and then i'd feel much worse again you know so it took a long time to learn to really get a deeper shift or to yeah well took five years to get fully well but it was a very up and down journey as well yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i imagine you tried some things over those years that didn't work what were some of those things\n\nSPEAKER_00: well for example quite early on i remember going to an acupuncturist who had written an article that said me and my me chronic fatigue recovery cure and i was like oh this is going to be the thing that's going to cure me so i had some acupuncture and she gave me some herbs as well which just tasted so bad and no it's not like against acupuncture because i love it and over the years it has been good since then and it did help it did help on some ways on my journey but that particular acupuncture or series of sessions didn't seem to do anything for me at that point but maybe it just wasn't the right thing at that point you know but later on i do think acupuncture did help a little bit i'm not quite anything against chinese medicine or acupuncture but it was yeah that didn't didn't particularly do anything in those early stages i'm trying to remember i mean i would at some point i started like trying one therapy after another you know i'd go for reiki and i'd go for this and i go for that and you know try different kinds of alternative therapies i went to a nutritional therapist she did colonic irrigation but i didn't even know apparently i brought in chronic irrigation but she gave me some nutrition advice and i do think i did have a you know like a candida issue as well so that perhaps was somewhat helpful to learn a bit about the body and things like candida imbalances and things like that but at the same time it wasn't that helpful i don't think yeah i don't know that makes sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: irrigation was that like colon hydrotherapy\n\nSPEAKER_00: they put water up you and like flush out your system yeah i've never had it done i didn't go for it but it was so in a way it was kind of funny that i hadn't even booked in for this session but i didn't think i had i thought i'd booked in to see a nutritional therapist again because my dad had told me that she'd helped cure someone of chronic fatigue you know so it was like following these different things these different lines of possibility for hope and a cure\n\nSPEAKER_01: i ended up doing colon hydrotherapy as one of the zillion things i tried to get well and did you keep watching if you've never tried it you haven't lived experience fully i think funny though i ended up meeting one of my best friends ever she was my colon hydrotherapist i think you just bond really quickly like you get past all the small talk once you're anyways it's the stuff that we all tried well it's just it's yeah that level of desperation\n\nSPEAKER_00: as well before even all this you know cold therapy that it's about these days but back then i remember reading an article about how cold can help me and i'd lying cold baths and i did often feel better afterwards i mean over there lying in a cold bath trying to get myself well yeah it's quite funny\n\nSPEAKER_01: i know you think about it we're going through this incredible suffering we have all these scary symptoms and then we're getting hoses put up our bums and laying in breathing full bath tubs it's like as if the suffering isn't enough we just kind of just desperate like okay if it even works for one person i gotta try it it's amazing that everyone i talked to your mind just suddenly becomes very open\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah i would try one thing and then the next thing and the next thing and i even flew to america i mean i'm in the uk and i flew to the us to florida to work with a healer that apparently had healed quite a few people of chronic fatigue as well so yeah just like loads of things i was i was so desperate to be well and to figure out what was going on\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah okay so eventually you did start to find some things that did help so what did that look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah well actually well two years into the illness i was doing a lot of meditation and i had an experience of meditation of a lot of energy flowing through my body and then i felt amazing like i felt like something had shifted but actually i ended up in quite an unstable kind of up and down process for three more years after that but i did think i was cured after two years through this meditation experience which is a bit mad but i was a bit intense about my meditation practice and i think i did have a kind of a release of energy but it was just not sustainable and yeah i still had a lot of things to figure out in myself but the things like towards the end of the recovery journey i read a book on reverse therapy and nickel therapy they were two practitioners i think that around the time they were working together at one point around reverse therapy and then they split off and did their own thing but i think i read both of their books and yeah something in that was like a bit of a light bulb for me about one of the key things i realized in myself was i had a massive pattern of like avoiding conflict at all costs like i could not possibly share something that might upset somebody else so i would just shut down and i think recognizing that pattern was one of the key parts for me to be able to get better and to sustain my health and i also didn't realize but i had quite a bit of suppressed anger and unresolved trauma in my system that i didn't realize was there\n\nSPEAKER_00: kind of started to come through in the various workshops and therapy sessions and coaching sessions i had during the five years to try and heal\n\nSPEAKER_01: okay so you mentioned two things there reverse therapy and mcale therapy so the first one reverse therapy what does that look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah they're very similar i can't remember the exact difference but it was about looking at symptoms and getting curious about symptoms and what is there an emotion underlying this symptom that's what i remember from it and starting to like really check in with myself and you know try and be more in tune with what was actually going on for me emotionally and yeah so that was a massive part i mean looking back i do think and all the research i've done around trauma i do think a lot of it for me was the impact of trauma on my system manifesting physically like a freeze response i don't know if you thought your perspective on that kind of stuff is but because even after i got better sometimes i'd go a little bit like a bit fatigue again and then i'd have to kind of work on something and then i'd feel back to normal again so it was yeah for me a lot of it when i look back i think was what's to do with the freeze response in my nervous system\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it's definitely a theme i couldn't begin to count how many people who have said something similar in their interview about that being a key piece of their recovery and it seems to be a core component of many recovery approaches like dr john sarno we hear a lot about his tms approach and lots of that theme of it's so mind blowing to me this is i think one of the most fascinating topics to me is how much those repressed emotions and that unresolved trauma can impact our nervous system and our brain and create all these symptoms and how much so many of us don't realize in our modern day society that we're walking around feeling like we are suppressing these things these feelings of anger and rage like i don't know i need to be a certain kind of person as a woman or a mother or a father or i need to be okay with working seventy hours a week or you know i have shame around this or it's not okay to feel this way or it's not okay to express my emotions and just by tampering all that down for all these years you know our system starts to recognize those feelings as scary and bad and it's fascinating how the body creates all these symptoms as a new distraction or is it because it's being hypersensitive or whatever the different theories are just understanding that and bringing that into light very impact for a lot of people yes\n\nSPEAKER_00: i mean i have one really strong example where i started to really understand the mind body connection you know i was with a group of people we were doing we were actually doing reiki on each other like a reiki share my boyfriend was there i was making tea for everyone my boyfriend was getting triggered because he thought i was going to tire myself out by doing too much and that he was going to have to pick up the pieces afterwards and then i was getting angry with him because you know because i felt like he wasn't trusting me and but i think it was just triggering some old stuff as well and then like i couldn't handle the anger so i remember just being like can't feel this i don't know what to do with it so just shut it down but then i could hardly walk and then i had to just lie down on the sofa and then he said something again that triggered me again and i just ran upstairs he said oh see i told you this is going to happen and i was like not because of that it's because i've done what to do with it yeah one moment the next moment i could run up the stairs i was like okay yeah this is really odd yeah what\n\nSPEAKER_01: did that look like for you starting to understand this mind body connection so what does that mean for starting to feel better and come out of this what does that look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah well i think a lot of it looked like learning to be more myself more authentic you know learning to express myself more authentically i remember learning non violent communication so i felt like when i had a bit of a way that i could communicate my feelings without it also being too much for someone else which i think initially because i had been so suppressed things would come out quite strongly at first you know like i remember alex howard i trained with him in coaching and he was talking about the pendulum that can swing from being you know very repressed to then the other way or a pendulum can swing from being one way to the other way and it's almost like coming back into balance again so i did notice that it was almost like i went from being so suppressed to then quite reactive and then had to learn how to be able to be authentic with people communicate my needs my feelings you know it's okay to have needs you know all these kind of things and but also to do things like continue to look after myself and you know prioritize time in nature prioritize time with friends prioritize self care as well as you know once i was better start developing my work and stepping into the world of work again after a long time of not being in the world of work but doing it in a way that was you know trying to be as balanced as possible and not too yeah not too out of balance yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's so interesting that so many of us go on this journey let's call it i mean it is a journey but can be very tough tough tough experience becoming so unwell and for many people last years it ends up being this teacher about how to like you said be more authentic take better care of yourself it is an amazing teacher and you know most people do come out the other side of it so much happier and more content and at peace and better equipped to deal with their life and their emotions and their health and the world it's it's fascinating i don't think most of us if you told us that coming into it we probably think you were crazy because it sounds even after doing all these interviews and i know it's true i know this is the case for so many people it's still every time i hear it my head kind of explodes you know yeah you're so sick it was like you need to lead a more authentic life yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: it definitely wouldn't have made sense when i first started to get sick but looking back i can be in a way i can be grateful for how much i learned through that journey of you know getting sick and figuring out how to be well again yeah how much so much learning so you've\n\nSPEAKER_01: talked about before or we talked about before this call preparing for this but you know the spiritual elements of your healing journey so can you talk a little bit about that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i don't know if you've had an old channel who shared anything like this i have had the odd client that's come to me with this but i also had a kundalini or spiritual some kind of spiritual awakening during my healing journey which is i think why the ups and downs were so intense i think i also there was also kind of trauma element of it like dissociation like coming out of my body definitely was part of the condition for me and part of what i had to work with afterwards was to learn really how to be in my body and i think spiritually i found something like meditation where i could have these really beautiful experiences sometimes i felt like i left my body and i was like connecting with the whole universe and you know it felt really amazing but then i but then i was really struggling to function in my life and my health was still all over the place you know sometimes i'd feel well and other times i crash again things like that so the spiritual element was an important element of my journey and yeah it's hard to describe it but i have also witnessed some other people who have also had that experience so it's kind of yeah happy to talk a little bit about that element of my journey yeah and i got deeply into meditation you know was reading so many books about buddhism and meditation and sometimes i was meditating at times when i was sick three hours a day and i actually got to the point where i had to stop meditating for a while because i was kind of using it in the wrong way i was using it to sort of escape everyday reality and have these mystical experiences but then actually finding it harder to function in everyday reality so i had to sort of yeah learn to do normal things for a while and connect with nature and you know be able to have a normal conversation i think after like a five year healing journey and then all the spiritual experience as well it was it was like yeah i just found normal life a challenge to integrate back into that makes sense that's a really\n\nSPEAKER_01: good point yeah because then once you're well and feeling better the rat race the world is waiting for you and\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that haven't been through what you've been through especially at such a young age i imagine just emotionally matured much more rapidly than most of us do at that time period in our lives probably challenging to you know connect or just see where this how this all fits together yeah sounds like this\n\nSPEAKER_01: changed you a lot clearly this whole experience has changed you a lot what has life been like since you've been well\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i mean life has been good overall i mean overall i feel like i've learned how to have experience a lot of joy a lot of inner peace you know i have a great community yeah i've had a child i've got a son who's ten yeah and life's been rich and great and i've you know done lots of different kinds of therapeutic and coaching trainings and been working in this field myself nearly twenty years so yeah there's been lots of great things i've run half marathons i think i did what partly want to prove like to the world of myself i am fully well you know yeah so yeah life's been life's been good and i feel like i've definitely learned so much through that time that shifted things for a deep level for me and also kept me interested in personal growth you know because i was like well how you know doing some emotional work and spiritual work and heal chronic fatigue and where else can i go with this you know how much joy can i create in this lifetime how much ease can i create and yeah so i do keep up quite a few of the practices that support me to heal and new practices you know always learning new things and do feel like i'm a lifelong learner as well i'm always fascinated by learning new things\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i was listening to you talk like how do i have more you in my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: this is i'm so inspired by how this has changed you and just the spiritual development and yeah that continuous growth i'm curious because a lot of us think of recovery from these conditions like there's a finish line where that chapter ends and then the rest of your life starts yeah but in reality a lot of people find it's more of an ongoing journey so what's that been like for you is there self care things you need to still do you know is there any part of you that's worried about you know becoming unwell again what's life kind of post recovery been for you\n\nSPEAKER_00: i mean it has been a really long time now so yeah it's been maybe seventeen years since i'd say the five years was up but in those years you know especially in the lesser in recent years but definitely sort of my later twenties early thirties i did have periodically sort of what i would now describe even back then i didn't always understand it would be like trauma type symptoms would come up like i'd feel a bit shut down or a bit dissociated and i wouldn't know why and then i'd have to go and do some work on myself with a practitioner or perhaps i'd go and spend some nighttime in nature and that would regulate me but i did have to quite yeah quite regularly kind of figure out how to regulate myself again when things were out of balance and that can still happen today but not to the extent it was still happening in my sort of late twenties early thirties and not as often so yeah but that was when i yeah i guess sort of started to see that it wasn't all about being chronically sick and definitely wasn't about being chronic sick anymore like i don't worry about that and i didn't worry about that i mean maybe a little bit in the early stages because i was a bit kind of like oh i've been ill for all these years now i need to make up for it i need to go and help at these retreats that i used to go and just receive i need to go and do all these things and i need to get this message of healing out into the world and you know and there was a bit of a kind of pushy energy and all of that sometimes but overall no i never worry about getting chronically sick again with chronic fatigue yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah amazing clearly this also shifted or influenced your career trajectory so you tell us a bit about that\n\nSPEAKER_00: well yeah yeah so i mean i trained my first training was with alex howard and the optimal health clinic and their therapeutic coaching training and actually even before that i train in some body work and doing the bowen technique so i actually started out i was a body work practitioner and then in time i ended up connecting to ashok gupta and i made the louis training program and ended up being a coach for the gut program which i have been for since two thousand and eight so really long time and yeah so that's kind of been a lot of my work actually has been a coach the gupta program more recent years i've trained in internal family systems ifs work which is about working with inner parts so i also work with people with ifs as well not necessarily through the gut program but just people with that model as well therapeutic model yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: wow what a wealth of information and knowledge and insight you are from all of this it's just incredible you know over the years the many years that you've now been doing this and working with people has your understanding of these conditions or recovery changed do you see a lot of variety in people's path to recovery and what are some of the biggest takeaways from the work that you've done\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah lots of different things but the power of recognizing the mind body connection and starting to understand that and do the work around that one piece that's perhaps a bit unique about what i bring is that looking back i feel a lot of my trauma wasn't necessarily personal but was ancestral was kind of more that i sort of took on from my family line so that that's a piece sometimes i see in clients that perhaps isn't spoken about so much that sometimes and particularly people are like oh not much happened to me but then you find out their mother's ill and their grandmother was ill or something like that what's going on in that family line that's created this pattern of illness for example\n\nSPEAKER_00: so yeah i also trained in family consolations work and that you know that's all about kind of how it affected by our wider family system and how an illness in one person might not be the root of that problem might actually be a more systemic or kind of wider family system issue so yeah that's an interesting\n\nSPEAKER_01: perspective it's fascinating i remember recently in animals and they can trace back if they have let's say a dog mother that has trauma they will see health problems in her children up to three generations after that from that and this is you know a study with dogs so i can even imagine how this all i'm sure i'm oversimplifying what you're saying here but just yeah of our families\n\nSPEAKER_01: so many things that we don't understand fully about what impacts our health and our world it's really fascinating yeah francis so grateful to you for being here today thank you

international travel i socialized a lot so i was busy i exercised it kind of did all the things that you think of doing in your early thirties and\n\nSPEAKER_00: i actually went on a trip to asia just for leisure but i ended up having a really traumatic experience when i was over there i was sexually assaulted and that led to a really grueling urinary tract infection that i got on a seventeen hour plane trip back and my whole system just kind of blacked out i actually sort of lost consciousness on the plane it was really an awful experience and when i got back to the states i was just really exhausted but i was still able to work and i still kind of pushed through things and i went to a few doctors i really sort of blocked out the trauma and i wasn't able to process that on a conscious emotional level and then strangely the next year around the same time of year it was like late fall i went back to asia and i was questioning the trip because i wasn't feeling that well that time i got these three colds kind of like back to back one was when i was there in china one was on the plane trip back and then one was once i returned back to san diego and then my system completely crashed after that i just went totally kaput i felt like i had the flu twenty four seven i had a lot of the quintessential me c f s symptoms i couldn't sleep at all overnight which was really the insomnia was a grueling one for me i was so exhausted for a number of weeks and even months i would say that i could hardly just walk around the house the brain fog was really bad i felt like i couldn't remember the name of you know a good friend or a colleague digestive issues i also started getting hot flashes and kind of like pre menopausal symptoms even though i was so young so that's kind of how all it began in a nutshell\n\nSPEAKER_01: so what did you think when all this started happening\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know i was so scared ray lynn i was just really i'm sure like you and so many people can relate i was just terrified because although i had had some fatigue it started really coming on very suddenly after those viruses\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i didn't in any way think about the trauma that had happened to me or actually a previous similar assault that happened when i was nineteen none of that was in my awareness i really was just wanting to get well so i did use whatever strength i have to start researching and going to doctors and basically my mom was driving me around because i couldn't really drive or do anything i was really lucky that i lived in the same town as my parents and i sort of just started urgently going to doctors everything from allopathic medicine to natural path medicine to integrative medicine at that point to some specialists and they did diagnose me with any c f s which at that time was largely called chronic fatigue syndrome more than the me post viral syndrome some of them would say there was some fibromyalgia in there because of all the body pain although that also can be very typical with with c f s\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i think i remember thinking on the one hand i was relieved to have a diagnosis because i suddenly couldn't go to work i had to just tell my boss well you know i used to be someone who would work like sixty hours a week and i just i can't go to work anymore so it sort of helped me in that way but on the other hand it was really devastating because i remember particularly a natural path a doctor who i had so much faith in and i thought well he's you know he's natural he's going to help me recover in a really gentle way and he specialized in this diagnosis and he actually said like we we don't know what the causes and we there is no cure and really you're going to have to live with this i mean that's all i can tell you and i just remember bawling you know being so devastated and really feeling like this was just this death sentence but in a way a life sentence that i was given that i would have to live with for years\n\nSPEAKER_01: when you got this diagnosis\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think so i mean it wasn't something that i didn't know anyone that had c f s maybe distantly i had heard of it but i really didn't know much about it and of course the diagnosis chronic fatigue syndrome sounds like you're just you just need a nap but my life was like feeling like i had the flu twenty four seven and i couldn't even sleep that was really hard because i never got any relief from the symptoms i would usually sleep like a couple hours a night but no it was really new to me and i you know i had been a reporter so i started researching as much as i could and seen as many doctors as i could over really what became the next thirteen years\n\nSPEAKER_01: initial times to any of these doctors or practitioners that you were seeing recommend any sort of treatment\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah there there were all kinds of things i mean like you i think i was on tons of supplements i was on probably forty or fifty different supplements at one time and i had all my little baggies and pillboxes lined up i didn't really ever see a change with that i went to dio a doctor of osteopathy who also practiced homeopathy and she put me on the anti candida diet so actually for years i wasn't even eating you know carrots or any grains or anything like that which really wasn't a diet that i liked i had been mainly plant based before but i was willing to do whatever and those things weren't making a difference so then i started really going to more specialists neurologists endocrinologist rheumatologists the rheumatologist actually suggested antiviral intervenious drugs and i had been a bit more natural but of course i was willing to try anything so i really thought this was going to work and my entire system crashed i ended up back in bed for months after those medications\n\nSPEAKER_00: i had done a lot of iv vitamins i got really into our your veda and i do think that kind of helped me live a little more healthy balanced life and start moving back into more plant foods but it didn't shift the symptoms i went to all kinds of energy healers and i actually did see a little relief with some of the energy healers but it would just be very short lived and i would kind of go back to my baseline oh gosh i went to even sleep psych their sleep psychologists their sleep doctors by the way there's every kind of sleep expert and that was still a really vexing symptom when i wouldn't sleep the symptoms would be a lot worse the next day and eventually i started going to see some psychologists because i was starting to connect\n\nSPEAKER_00: there was a lot of psychological you know trauma and grief that happened before the onset of these symptoms and in these years i should say not to sound like this is such a sob story but i know you really place a value on just being honest with our stories there was a lot of personal griefs my father was very ill and eventually passed away about five years into my illness my mother almost died and they were like my rocks i was single engagement had broken up because it was just so hard to sustain you know he didn't he couldn't really understand why i couldn't do anything anymore i was about to lose my house i had lost the career i really loved so it was just there was a lot going on and now what what i know in how i healed i see how all those emotional stressors were really activating my brain and nervous system and making the symptoms worse i didn't really make those connections at the time but i do think some psychotherapy was helpful just to kind of talk through some of these some of these griefs that were going on\n\nSPEAKER_01: a lot of heavy hard things you're hit with i'm so sorry that you have to go through all of that how did this impact you know emotionally psychologically people understandably start feeling severe depression what was\n\nSPEAKER_00: thank you for acknowledging that i think those of us who go through this need to be acknowledged and a lot of times are really not in the health care system we're just sort of this body that is trying to get better but at times i fell into some depression i'm lucky in that i never say deep into a depression and i never really actively thought about taking my life but i remember just years where i felt like what's the point of living at all i mean on doing is taking these supplements like eating foods i don't even like for what i have no purpose anymore it was really hard to socialize too because when i would it would activate symptoms so i wasn't doing a whole lot of that other than a couple close friends and family that would come visit so it did take its toll i think though for the most part i was able to kind of keep some just some hope and some optimism although doctors were saying we don't have a cure there was something in me that was like but this isn't me like this isn't my life this is not how it's going to go i know that there's something that can get well there's something in me even that is well and that can heal on this physical level and i was always a somewhat spiritual person but i started meditating and really practicing yoga and i think that sense of spiritual connection to something that was greater than myself really helped i think it helped with my emotions and helped just feel like there was some hope and there was there was some kind of broader picture than i was able to see right now you\n\nSPEAKER_01: made a lot of changes a lot of big changes like in your lifestyle and your diet and i think a lot of us do that or asked to do that right off the start i'm just curious how you found that you know when i first got my diagnosis i was told you know more sugar gluten nor alcohol no more i mean i was drinking at the time but sugar and the gluten were still very much in my life and i had a raging sugar addiction and then i was just sent home and just like make all these changes live off of ko and it was really tough for me and then a lot of self you know because i was sticking to this plan all the time it was supposed to help so what was the process like for you making all of these changes oh my\n\nSPEAKER_00: gosh i can relate to all of that you know it was like not only are you totally miserable but we're going to take away anything you enjoy eating which is like one of the few kind of pleasures left so i was also on you know the gluten free dairy free sugar free i also i couldn't drink any caffeine or alcohol if i would just have a sip i would be shot for days even more so\n\nSPEAKER_00: i was on the elimination diet so there was just basically i was eating like protein usually either chicken or fish and cooked vegetables because i would get really bloated if i would have salad so yeah it was it was kind of miserable i mean it just sort of felt like this deprivation and i think too in looking back there was a part of me that really resented it because i didn't feel like i was an active participant at that point in my own healing you know really felt like i went to sort of more natural pathogen doctors because i thought there is going to be more inclusionary but in a lot of ways it was still like ok there take this medication take this supplement take this herb do this diet and i just sort of felt like it was being done to me and actually i did have a really perceptive doctor years later i saw for the c f s and although he didn't really help me with the symptoms he helped me emotionally because actually he said you know what i think you think i'm going to tell you to take a bunch more supplements and more restrictive diets and i suspect that's actually perpetuating the trauma in which you felt you were in control of your body and now you're just being told what to do with your body by all these medical professionals and rayland i just started crying i was like someone sees me and i didn't even know that's how i felt but i think for those of us even if there isn't a trauma what i find with other people i meet who have c f s is often if not always there's a lot of stress beforehand and there can be a sense then whether it was existent before or certainly after the diagnosis of just being so powerless and so i started realizing with diet and everything else at some point i have to regain my agency and my power and my collaboration in my healing because otherwise i was resenting it and i and i just i think those diets didn't work partly because of that and partly because the root cause of my c f s was not that i wasn't eating enough kale right that wasn't the cause or that i wasn't taking thirty supplements a day\n\nSPEAKER_01: such a good point one of the things that i just love about these interviews is that i learned something about my own journey and i get more insight every single person i talk to hadn't really thought about you know and i make when i made the switch later on in my journey to plant based it was so easy i did it effortlessly but it was my choice and i had just it was my idea and i believed in it so in the beginning when those were imposed on me it was really challenging and i found even though i was thought i was committed i was forever trying to find work around like ok i can't have gluten i can't have sugar i really want some chicken fingers so i took some chicken and cornflakes and i deep fry them and then i think the sauce made out of like stevia\n\nSPEAKER_01: or you know like not healthy food at all but there was no sugar\n\nSPEAKER_01: right make all these desserts that were like raisins and somehow maple syrup and like why didn't sugar in there so i like diet sodas like diet orange soda so i get\n\nSPEAKER_01: myself up in the beginning with so much crap trying to like find me like ok\n\nSPEAKER_00: absolutely and especially i remember watching a video where you were talking about you know for me i just feel better on plant based diets and that's what i found too and so i think especially if you're being asked to eat in a way that just doesn't feel right to your body for whatever reason not that there is one right or wrong diet but for you there's going to be resentment you're right you're going to try to find ways around it that are necessarily nutritional\n\nSPEAKER_01: so what happened what\n\nSPEAKER_00: so let's see i think that you know this whole thirteen year saga had different phases and and i would say the first five years i was really impaired meaning i couldn't do much out of the house i mean i could still take care of myself which was really nice but my parents would bring groceries and things\n\nSPEAKER_00: then i would say like the next maybe five or six years i had a little more ability and mobility and i could do things like i could go to a local yoga studio and i would notice when i would do things that i would enjoy especially that was really calming and soothing i would get a little more energy so i mean i was doing like a lot of restorative yoga but still i was getting out i could see friends a little bit more but like not in the evenings if i saw a friend in the evening i have insomnia i wouldn't sleep all night\n\nSPEAKER_00: so but what i really noticed over time was kind of back to this point of personal agency and starting to like tune into really what works for me was i noticed when i would be in nature which i really loved when i would read poetry or i love listening to eckhart tolle i actually couldn't read a lot that was the thing because of the brain fog i could only really read people like eckhart tolle because he writes a few words and it means so much or i could read poetry because it was just a few words right but i started really getting into that i started writing poetry i started actually just more doing what gave me a little bit of peace or relief rather than just trying to fix myself and get rid of the symptoms wasn't that i totally gave up on it but i would say i mean this took well over a decade to kind of like get off the roller coaster because i just noticed again and again i was so exasperated by trying every last diet every supplement every i mean i one point i was doing like enemas every single night all these rituals deep detoxes ten days worth and i was just like none of these things have worked and so i just kind of started tuning into my own self and my own body and then i had this one experience which actually ended up being a blessing where i thought oh i'll try one more healer so this woman was supposedly a shamanic healer she was like a white woman in san diego who had done a little bit of training in the amazon and so she i went in for a session with her and she was kind of smoking her pipe and she asked me about the trauma and i actually started opening up for some reason and really crying and she changed the subject and said you know i don't think we should talk about this let's talk about my cat which i'm dressing up for halloween and so i think somehow she got triggered or something but i felt so shut down and so numb after that and i wrote her out a two hundred dollars check i left there numb and i was just like i am never going to give away my power to someone else like here i'm thinking this woman who's not even listening to me who's shutting me down is going to heal me and it's just not going to happen not to say i didn't think i needed help from people or that we don't need support but it shifted kind of the power dynamic because the situation with her was so ridiculous you know that i was paying her two hundred dollars to tell me about her cat costume now about twelve years in something happened i was actually meditating a lot i got me into transcendental meditation and kind of the inner teachings of yoga which really teach us that everything on the outside including our health comes from our internal state at least there's some origin with you know our minds and so i was just fascinated with all these philosophies and studies practices and it lit me up and i felt like i got to this point where some kind of surrender happened and i know that sounds really cliche but it's hard to describe i fell into this state of peace there was actually mental peace even though i still had the same symptoms and i kind of was almost observing myself there would be intense flu like you know aching but i felt it in my body but i was kind of watching it and there was this internal state of nonresistance or peace and it really wasn't something i tried to do although i had been studying about it but it kind of happened and interestingly that went on for a year i mean so it didn't actually shift the physical symptoms but i sort of was it's not like i wanted them to be there i mean this was this whole situation sucked it was treacherous it was a grueling but at that point somehow i wasn't fighting it and so i feel like from that place i really wasn't pursuing medical interventions i was eating what i wanted which which is like mostly plant based organic whole foods i just like that you know it felt good to my body it was kind of like intuition nutrition i would i couldn't work i was on disability and there was that bothered me i mean i wanted a purpose i wanted to contribute but i just kind of accepted this is where i am right now and so from that place interestingly as i started just like pursuing what i enjoyed i took this online writing class called right into light and i met this woman and she said oh i recovered from c f s through this type of mind body work if you want we can set up a phone conversation and i also got migraine so i was like well i can only talk on the phone for ten minutes but yeah i would love to do that\n\nSPEAKER_00: so we set up this conversation we start talking and she starts telling me all her symptoms were exactly the same you know and she had epstein bar and she had all these things and that she made this total recovery well i told her i could talk for ten minutes three hours later i actually got up and ran around the block like i had not ran in thirteen years i had something of like a mini spontaneous remission now this was not the end of the story you know symptoms did come back so i don't want people to think oh that doesn't happen to me it can't happen but what that conversation showed me was that i could recover and what really changed for me was she explained that all these years doctors had been saying these viruses were suppressing my immune system so it was like the epstein bar and ten other viruses that i just couldn't overcome and so to me i felt like that's this insurmountable physical thing but she explained she had all those diagnoses she had all those viral titers and what happened was she learned that it was more how her brain and nervous system were processing stress and just stuck in this hyper vigilant mode and essentially her brain had learned these patterns these neuropathways and she recovered and at the end of this conversation now you would think this would be infuriating but by this point i was so with her she said rebecca you're not sick you know and i think she kind of alluded you're just you're stressed you've been through trauma your system stuck in this pattern but you can get out of it and i believed it i believed it one hundred percent like i felt it in all of me and my body reacted with that that burst of energy at least in that moment\n\nSPEAKER_01: wow so in that conversation it wasn't even as if you were doing some sort of you know therapy or work on yourself it was just this breakthrough of understanding of what was happening and it gave you this break from symptoms at least for a little bit exactly\n\nSPEAKER_00: exactly and that's a really good point because i think for me what the key was even though this woman wasn't a therapist she wasn't a doctor she and i had been a science journalist so i love science and she kind of explained the science of what can happen in our brain and nervous system with chronic fatigue chronic pain brain fog with all these symptoms and it made sense to me and so i felt like she was literally rediagnosing me which is crazy because she's not a medical professional but i felt like i can overcome this because it's now a matter of understanding this knowledge learning how i can calm down my nervous system start feeling my emotions start challenging myself more like getting back to more activities to sort of retrain my brain and it was kind of like to me and i'm not saying this is for everybody but for me i felt like i finally heard the truth like this resonated with me with what was happening and it gave me hope that i could recover instead of just being like viruses or faulty genes or mitochondria or things i couldn't do anything about\n\nSPEAKER_00: and after i had that little spontaneous remission i ran around the block multiple times i knew i was on the right path i knew beyond a shadow of a doubt and that's all it was was knowledge i mean it was just information which is really crazy and i think it was her caring like she cared a lot to help me she spent three hours on the phone with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: absolutely incredible and it just it makes me question so many things about my own experience in my own story and you're talking about food and for years i couldn't eat rice it made me incredibly sick it was one of my food intolerances and even after i recovered i still have some rice feel sick i was terrified of rice and i lived in asia for eight and a half years so that was a challenging situation but just recently i just started trying having little tiny bits like oh i feel okay let's try to have a little bit more oh i feel okay and now i can eat copious amounts and i'm fine and i just assumed okay my body must have healed it but now i'm thinking you know it might have just been a brain association all those years that i had built up triggering that response and then as i built that confidence with like a little bit i'm ok a little bit i'm okay brought up and socialized not to attribute attribute our physical symptoms to something that's being caused by the brain like we don't even see the connection at all like there's a wall here where this stuff starts where this stuff starts and it's just exactly to see that that's\n\nSPEAKER_00: not the case so fascinating well exactly and you know what's so interesting we're raised like you say to see like a physical symptom has to have a physical cause but now there's actually a whole body of neuroscience and scientific research showing that there's just two studies out this year one out of harvard and one out of boulder but the basically shows chronic pain is caused and cured by a form of brain retraining by this specific approach because the brain generates pain and it generates pain as well as fatigue because it senses danger but that danger can be psychological as well as physical it's the same part of the brain that perceives it and so what's so ironic is that the doctor i ended up studying with to train in this howard schubiner who i highly recommend his book called unlearn your pain and he talks about fatigue he talks about these food sensitivities as well and he really helped me see it's like not necessarily that some food is bad for us or some behavior is that our brain perceives it so if you eat a poisonous berry the next time you see that berry you'll get queasy because your brain via your body is trained to protect you but you might see another berry like a blueberry and you could get queasy because that part of the brain the emotional limbic centers aren't like particularly discriminating they're just sort of picking up information in our environment and if we're stressed or in our nervous system hypervigilant they can mistake that like rice isn't good for me or whatever we're told by our doctors isn't good but this dr schupner actually led me to believe and it became true that i could eat all these foods it's just that my brain had become so scared of them so of course this is not true with an actual like food allergy like peanuts and things i mean that really does exist but with the sensitivities to food i know it kind of blows your mind and i'm not trying to say that people should just start eating all these things i mean you have to decide for yourself but what you're describing to me is interesting that it sounds very similar when you can kind of retrain yourself that you know it wasn't an innate food allergy it's an association or a condition response it's like pavlov's dog right it's the same dynamic\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah and i think thank you for taking the time to explain all that because i think that's an important distinction because i think a lot of us myself included sometimes get a bit put back or like are you saying just imagining this whole thing and it's not that it doesn't exist you know our brain is a very real part of our body it's another organ that we have so it is creating conditions in our body it is something that is real it's just not maybe caused by the organ that we think is causing it it's originating from a different place in the body\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i'm so glad you said that because i know like all of us who have dealt with cfs we've been told like you're making this up or we've been doubted so i so get that people are sensitive to this and these symptoms are a hundred percent real and the people who i've mentioned dr sarno and dr schubiner whose work really helped me they're very clear this is a hundred percent real but like you said the brain is like the master control so like we know the brain and the nervous system are constantly scanning for danger and if they sense it they'll go into flight fight or freeze mode to protect you so either to help you to run or fight and you're flooded with stress hormones or to shut you down if the danger seems too big i think with cfs the danger seems too big a lot of times and we become frozen and our brain and nervous system is trying to help us it's creating real physical symptoms they could not be more real\n\nSPEAKER_00: but in my case at least i came to believe that the things i was told were causing the symptoms were more like effects like the epstein bar i'm sure was higher because my brain and nervous system weren't functioning optimally and so when you're prepared to run or fight your digestion is not a priority your hormones aren't a priority all these other things are not working as well that's true the immune system isn't a priority but what i found for me is that wasn't the answer because that was the effect not the cause and the cause was like going to the brain but also like not to say this is caused by emotions because i know that can put people off and they can think oh i'm being told i'm just emotional or depressed it's not that at all but one thing i really feel is missing in the medical system is acknowledging we are living breathing feeling human beings and back to when darwin wrote about the evolutionary value of emotions emotions are actually what tells our brain and nervous system whether we're safe or not safe whether to trigger the flight fight freeze response right if there's fear that response the nerve firing patterns change\n\nSPEAKER_00: the hormones change to help us so emotions are the cue so to act like i just felt like doctors didn't ever ask once was there anything stressful possibly happening in your life before you went from being this active tv news reporter to being homebound no one asked that and it's like where's the heart and the humanity much less the neuroscience and i don't mean to blame or implicate i know everybody's doing their best but i think we need like more trauma informed care and even more understanding that the brain and the nervous system do react from fear in perpetuating symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_01: i find it really interesting you talked about the pain because there's so many people who are living with chronic pain and unfortunately with my experience i had some but it wasn't serious and i just i don't know how people function with that level of chronic pain in their life and then recently i reviewed the curable app because people kept telling me about it and through that process just learning about the app how it works reading reviews reaching out to people the mecfs community asking about their experience with it and a lot of people are having significant success or completely having their pain gone because of using this and it is coming from the premise that the chronic pain is originating in the brain so is that all part of like the process of your recovery is there something similar\n\nSPEAKER_00: such a great question i'm really glad to see curable and other things like that are kind of gaining more acceptance curable is based on this exact same approach so one of the doctors i mentioned howard schubiner is on the board of curable john sarno has passed away but he was kind of considered the early pioneer in this so curable is based on this and i actually discovered not the curable app but john sarno's work in this this whole mind body approach much earlier in my cfs journey but i discovered sarno's book healing back pain which by the way back pain neck pain all these chronic pains are also usually caused by the brain and nervous system rather than a structural issue but i couldn't see how to apply that to myself it was like but i have exhaustion i have brain fog i have all these other things and i think when i met that woman i'm ever grateful for kathy and she explained she used a very similar approach as curable and she just sort of used fatigue as a synonym and later i reached out to howard schubiner and\n\nSPEAKER_00: did a training with him and i asked him and he said it's the same thing because if you think of fatigue there's a part of you that doesn't feel safe and it's sort of like your system's trying to like shut you down and like keep you at home and it did feel like that for me like i think there was a perception this is subconscious by the way because ninety percent of our brain and emotions including our emotions are subconscious so we're not aware of them but i think that for me there was this perception like the world's not safe anymore after that assault and it was sort of like my system trying to keep me at home now it is a bit of a painful way to try to protect you but you know this we're dealing with also kind of some reptilian parts of the brain fear based parts of the brain but anyway to go to your point i haven't done the curable app because i already recovered through some of the other books and through coaching but it's it's really the same approach and people can apply it to brain fog and digestive issues and fatigue as well so\n\nSPEAKER_01: my body approach what would one day one week in your life look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: so do you mean like more when i was recovering or just today yet more when i was recovering ok so yeah both because i still i still integrate it but i would say when i was still over that first year i was every day doing these meditations called somatic tracking so i'm really glad curable i'm told by some of my clients now has somatic tracking meditations on there but basically you don't even need a meditation but it's helpful to be guided where you're just kind of tracking sensations in your body so it's like the fatigue might end up feeling like you know heaviness through your whole body or say i would have a lot of burning in my arm so i would bring my mind into that but you're getting these messages of safety like i'm safe and ok there's actually nothing wrong with my body so you're kind of retraining your brain and i would do that every day i would actually do it every night as well and i feel like it broke the insomnia habit and i say habit because that's also kind of a subconscious learned behavior that the bed becomes associated with anxiety so i would do the somatic tracking usually a few different meditations every day i would i just love reading the books there's different podcasts on this approach curable has one there's others that i really like called tell me about your pain is one of them so i was learning about it and then i would like go and start to do things i was like oh i'm going to go try to walk a half a mile or a mile or something at this point i would just walk a little more and i would notice the symptoms so as i'm doing it the symptoms are rising i'm getting that malaise and i would just be like reiterate like you know i'm ok i got this i i know what's going on and that's like how you retrain your brain that you can do these things which i think a lot of people do anyway through graded exposure you know honestly it doesn't take a lot of time this approach it's kind of just learning it doing the meditations i would see this coach once a week in the beginning then every other week and just started really adding on activities to my life including food i started eating more things that i wanted and at first like you do have a reaction because your brain thinks that's not good for you but then within usually a few times i could just eat it ok it's crazy i know it does sort of seem wild and i think that there has to be a certain pacing and timing with this because i'll say i was really ready i would have been able to just jump into this years before when for one i didn't really believe it and i was bed bound so i mean just to have like compassion for people i think that was another thing i really brought in raylan and again it's not that it took time but i started bringing in self compassion when i would get symptoms i would just ask how am i feeling emotionally because with this work you want to bring it back to the emotions because we so focus on the physical symptoms but you really want to tend to the emotions which are driving the state of the nervous system so it's like how am i feeling emotionally and i would acknowledge i'm scared i'm really scared i'm really frustrated and then i would just kind of be compassionate with myself and i still am to this day like that's really hard you know just talk to myself i'm so sorry what do you what do you want or need right now instead of just pushing myself i would challenge myself but if i needed to back down i would and sometimes take a break and just kind of tune into like what do you want or need it just has gotten to be and now over it's been a few years a much more kind of personal attentive way of dealing with yourself i mean it sounds funny to be talking to yourself but i think we all do anyway so it's just doing it in a much more compassionate way where i used to beat myself up like you had said for not recovering i was like i'm failing what's wrong with me you know and i mean that dr schumer and others will explain that self criticism actually does activate the danger alarm signal in the brain and the nervous system so it actually can feed into symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_00: and so yeah just being a lot more like compassionate with myself like this is really hard but we can do hard things and we'll pick it back up when when it's time\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i know you and i have talked about before\n\nSPEAKER_01: personality traits but some people at least\n\nSPEAKER_01: is kind of illnesses people who drive themselves hard people who are critical of themselves so do you think that plays a role in symptom perpetuation or impacts recovery in some way\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know when people read john sarno's books and there's one called the mind body prescription and he describes the personality type of people who get chronic symptoms and he does talk about c f s but he also talks about chronic pain and other symptoms that he believes had an origin in the brain and nervous system and he describes like perfectionist check right people pleasers check maybe you're doing things for other people instead of for yourself people who are like really conscientious hard driving\n\nSPEAKER_00: put a lot of pressure on themselves to do things well and i just felt like i was seeing myself in those pages and as i meet people with c f s and you meet so many people\n\nSPEAKER_00: i do see that pattern a lot like we're and also and not just that with myself with a lot of people i meet it's like not only are we putting all this pressure and stress and even sometimes criticism on ourselves but we're holding the emotions it so it becomes kind of like a pressure cooker right like if you have a water that's boiling with the lid on eventually it's going to burst because we're holding in all the pressures i remember i know i keep bringing him up but he's such a kind man and i think he's really very forward looking but dr schubiner in a training was saying people who get c f s and these chronic symptoms they're really nice people like i get to work with the nicest people right because it's not people who take out their stuff on other people but the flip side of that is like kind of holding in the emotions\n\nSPEAKER_00: part of that too i'll throw in i did some journaling like expressive writing to kind of like really just get out all the frustration i didn't mention that earlier in my practices but just to kind of like let myself really journal and write about anything that i'm too nice to say to anyone\n\nSPEAKER_00: that that was actually that was helpful and then yeah back to your point the personality traits i think just learning that you know we all kind of learn this with with any c f s like we can't be perfectionists right like some of us i mean i was lucky if i could just take a shower some days so it kind of softened and that was that was a good thing but then when i recovered and went back to work i did see some of those tendencies come back and i do actively work with it where i'll notice if i'm pushing too hard like if i'm feeling stressed or pressure like i got to gotta got to get these things done i can start getting a little fatigue and i can also start getting i recovered from interstitial cystitis through the same work the bladder pain i can get like little hints of it but i'm always able to link it to like emotional stress either that happened to me or that i put myself under\n\nSPEAKER_00: and once i'm aware of it usually the symptoms subside or sometimes i'll do like the somatic tracking meditation i mentioned to you or something like that but i think i softened you know i still i still have some of that you know i don't think we have to like totally change who we are to get well again but i found it was a wake up call to be more kind to myself and more authentic in who i always was where i think in many ways before i liked my life as a t v news reporter but in a lot of ways it wasn't really me i mean i do tend to like a quieter more introspective life i like to do more writing and i think a lot of times it's like more finding who you really are and who you really are in treating yourself like you would treat a good friend i think these things can actually help more than we know and they have helped me a lot and i feel with a lot of people that it can really help them to make those connections like this isn't just unkind to myself like it's actually affecting my health\n\nSPEAKER_01: and light bulb moment for me when you're talking like oh my goodness the anger and how we are kind of really nice people really like her community\n\nSPEAKER_00: right we're so nice which made\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know a joy\n\nSPEAKER_00: but you know who else has helped me more recently is kristen neff's work on self compassion because a lot of times when we are like hard driving we just take it out on ourself but to realize like this is really really hard like to have compassionate compassion on ourself is also really helpful and can soften the blow\n\nSPEAKER_00: all these losses yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that compassion piece is massive and also that release i remember i was interviewing daniel on this channel and he's just incredible and i learned so much from him as well but he talked about how important it is to journal your anger and i thought i'm not angry i don't have to try it so i added it to my morning journaling practice my angry but i was angry about a lot\n\nSPEAKER_01: of just i thought he was crazy so it is a little bit of that bottling and you know i was and i was born and raised in canada we're very strongly socialized to be polite and keep\n\nSPEAKER_01: waves and so yeah it's just so much happening with the emotions and our personalities and how we treat ourselves how we interact with other people it's just really really important things\n\nSPEAKER_01: incredible and get up here on the screen somewhere if you want to check it out i was giving it a watch because he's just\n\nSPEAKER_01: when you when you had this realization of what your path was going to be and you started doing all this work how long did it take you from you first started when you got to a place where you felt pretty much functionally recovered\n\nSPEAKER_00: i would say that i had that first boost which was amazing for a few days to actually like and i had been going through a really symptomatic period where i was kind of back in bed a lot of the time it was in the early winter of two thousand and eighteen and to go from that to running around the block and actually feeling pretty good was stark but then i would say it took about probably eight or nine months till i felt like i'm really recovered and even probably a year before i was adding a lot more things like back to some international travel so in the mind body way of thinking and this learned associations we're talking about because i had had these traumas happen overseas so i had the assault i had that airplane trip i told you about so when i would try to go near an airplane i mean my brain i would get so many symptoms but i started connecting this is just like a perceived danger even though i'm going to a different place so it took maybe a year to kind of get back to some more travel and being really active of course that was before the pandemic i'm not doing a lot of traveling but yeah and honestly i still incorporate this in my daily life you know i still love kind of doing a somatic meditation throughout the day if i notice myself getting stressed or pressuring myself or maybe just not feeling quite tipped top i just sort of check in what's going on emotionally notice what my thoughts are it just becomes a way of life but i think yeah it's been wow three years now feel really grateful i'm at this point where i know there's so many years where it's i would never want to go through it again honestly and i wouldn't want anyone to have to it's so hard but i am at this point where it's like i'm grateful for the ways i've grown that i don't know if i would have otherwise you know i might still be pushing myself and beating myself up and trying to really find my own sense of self esteem through my career which i largely realized i was doing to try to feel better about myself but now it comes more from inside you know there's just more acceptance and things so i think these all can be gifts like whatever your path is you know we all kind of learn these lessons and i know it's at some point that's really annoying to hear but right and i get that but i do feel yeah i live a lot more balanced peaceful life than i used to for sure\n\nSPEAKER_01: is a massive gift at this experience or it can be every single person i talk to every single person i've interviewed recovered something similar they're just a better place than they were before and they've learned so much such a weird thing like i used to my own journey i'm like do i have\n\nSPEAKER_01: a little bit myself even just thinking about being grateful for that hell what i take it away if i had choice and it's just such a crazy thing to think i don't think i would just mind blowing and i'm sure if someone had said that to me when i was really in the thick of it i would want to punch them in the face but i would just\n\nSPEAKER_00: hold it exactly but you know to me that's like a really form of going to the acceptance and healing to get to that point where it's like how i would take it away i'm grateful for what i've learned and just to kind of share that that a lot of lessons come i mean i see it as sort of like for me and i see this with a lot of people to some degree some of the things that led or fed into the symptoms not to say it was our fault there's a lot of things we don't understand about this disease but some of the things that fed into it we have the chance to kind of rebalance in ourselves and then they make the quality of life a lot better like turning self criticism into self compassion learning to take more personal empowerment in my case instead of just thinking that doctors or someone else is going to fix me or heal me and granted it wasn't their fault because i was also kind of giving them that power but realize like wow there's so much resilience inside and for me i've learned nothing's going to work unless i intuitively feel right about it like if i'm doing something as a means to an end whether it's about my health or anything else it never goes well it just never does so like retapping into that intuition has been a big one to what\n\nSPEAKER_01: did it feel like for you after so many years being unwell to relatively quickly recover after twelve or more years\n\nSPEAKER_00: i remember feeling every day waking up like a kid like oh my gosh i have energy i can go take a walk i can at that point it wasn't necessarily back to running but i can go explore the world anything i could do just felt like it was brand new like i was learning it for the first time i remember i went to a zoom class and this would have been some months in to the recovery but the teacher i mean i'm not like the most you know coordinated dancer but i do love to dance and i felt like everybody else there was like following in steps i never taken zoom but that was this craze that happened when i had c f s so i was like completely like the class is going one way i was going the other way i was so happy i was overjoyed and there must have been like eighty people in the class at the end of it the teacher came up and she's like i have never seen someone so happy in this dance class like regular zumba people so it was like i was so happy that i could dance so it is it is amazing i would kind of question it sometime and i would be like but i would have symptoms that would come up i'd have flare ups a lot so i was kind of reminded like ok when i would kind of question like is this real you know it was like it is real but it yeah it's a quality stabilize i think now things for me like maybe there's a little less of being able to do things but there's definitely more appreciation kind of more of like a stable appreciation every day for just simple things that aren't that simple when you have me right taking a walk meeting a friend being able to work big one or just do what you really want to do\n\nSPEAKER_01: i notice it a lot when i just have a really busy day and i go through this crazy day or maybe a really busy week and i mean i get a bit tired i'm still human push yourself so far\n\nSPEAKER_01: look what i can do this is incredible and i still have these moments even though like you it's not you know the little things you start used to it but i still\n\nSPEAKER_01: mirror because it took me a while to fully trust it it was like a tentative like here\n\nSPEAKER_01: might hear me gloating and it might come back it's a good it's an amazing place to finally be and i only recently just got to this place where i feel comfortable and like ok it's fully behind me it's really amazing because i know for so many of us for all those years if you like you're never going to get there we did it yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i mean recovering from c f s is the hardest thing i've ever done by far it really is amazing sometimes you kind of question it but i think that's a good thing because it makes you appreciate it right and i saw your video recently talking about i know this is behind me and it actually gave me more confidence i was like wow she's got like such certainty that's that's amazing because i think i do sometimes still question it a little bit\n\nSPEAKER_00: but it's all kind of in stages right yeah it's all stages and then you get to the point where you feel it's behind you and you've recovered but yet you have all these things you've learned and that you still integrate\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's a good place to be and that's why i just did that video because i didn't do it until now because it was the first time realizing\n\nSPEAKER_01: trusting this is behind me it's interesting\n\nSPEAKER_01: like so many of us this whole experience shapes your focus for your career your passions so porter\n\nSPEAKER_00: right no i'm not i for so many years all i wanted to do was get well and go back to being a news reporter because i really did enjoy that i knew i wanted that profession from the time i was in sixth grade you know i wrote my career report wanted to be a journalist but i changed so much along the way when i did finally recover there was just nothing in me that really wanted to go back to that i thought about it but also this the nature of news had changed it's so two hundred and forty seven now and it's a little bit insane and also i think what i was so incredibly struck by how many practitioners i went to fifty doctors and healers over the course of thirteen years i spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and the thing that helped me was this woman speaking to me like really caring about me listening to my story asking what had happened what stressors happened kind of explaining the science and i covered through that and so i just was led to train in that field even though i had recovered myself i did a number of trainings in my body training nervous system life coaching and things over a couple years and then i really call myself a mind body coach so i work with people really with all kinds of diagnosis that are generated by the brain and nervous system a lot of people with any c f s come to me but it's also people with chronic fatigue chronic headaches\n\nSPEAKER_00: back pain things like that and i should say not everything is generated by the mind and body i mean there are tumors there are fractures there are infections there are things that actually have a pathological cause that can be treated and should be treated right it's just when there's things that don't seem to have a clear cause or a clear cure that we kind of look more to this connection so yes i work with people one on one and i teach group classes because it is it is a different paradigm so i feel like\n\nSPEAKER_00: people can can learn about this approach in a really inexpensive way they can get some of the books or listen to the podcast but it is sort of important to see if it resonates or not because part of what the healing is as you heard with my light bulb moment is actually really getting it that like the cause of these symptoms and that alone can turn down the fear of the in the danger signal in the brain which calms the nervous system which calms the symptoms so because of that i started teaching classes because i saw it was really important for people to kind of have knowledge and different meditations and it's been really fun to be kind of in community with people so that's what i do now full time and i write about this quite a bit and use my journalism or writing about my body healing i blog and that kind of thing and it really does feel like my calling you know it feels like something i would just do for free because i want to do it but it has i got to this point where it's like ok either need to get another job because i'm off disability or really make this my vocation i just decided i wanted to do this full time so it's been interesting growing my own business but it's really it's from my heart and i really love it it's amazing to see people not just recover but like learn and heal and grow as people\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think that's just incredible i don't have to tell you or anybody watching that there is such\n\nSPEAKER_01: out there i think that's why so many of us are silver lining or you know another gift of this whole thing we come through it and then be compassionate about wanting to connect with the other people who are facing similar things because we see this massive gap in the medical system with millions of people in it that are just lost and alone and trying to figure this out and not getting\n\nSPEAKER_01: many of them any kind of hopeful support so on your website on like it's just\n\nSPEAKER_01: pulling each other out of this together which i think is a really incredible thing so i'm just so grateful for you and the work that you do and that you're out there providing this kind of support\n\nSPEAKER_00: thank you rayland i'm so grateful to you honestly i'm so touched by looking at how much you give out how much you put out to do this just to support the community it's clear that your heart is so in it and you just really want to help people and i know that you're a lifeline for a lot of people so thank you\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's really heartbreaking thing to see how many people are still suffering specially when you know that suffering so intimately so yeah you know i used to think when i first started doing this channel people would say reach out to me and beautiful messages because of you because of your channel and the people on your channel i have hope like\n\nSPEAKER_01: this is worth it just for that just for that and the more time people reaching out to me because of the people on your channel i found a way to recover and fully recovered again and it's just this is just\n\nSPEAKER_01: the most selfish thing i've ever done because i get so much out of it it's really rewarding so it's a good motivator to keep out of really incredible thing to be able to connect with people in this way even if you can help the teeniest tiniest little bit it's really amazing so if people want to learn more about the work that you do or follow you in social spaces how can they do that\n\nSPEAKER_00: the best way is probably through my website which is just rebeccatolan com because i have some like free somatic meditations on there if you want to try it out i have a blog i have loads of just free there's a resource page and a media page and a lot of it is sort of geared to how you can use the approach you would find in the curable app but for fatigue because a lot of people that try that approach are like they're not talking about chronic fatigue much less mecfs which we know is not just fatigue so that's really the best way i'm also on facebook but i'm just not a huge social media person so probably the website and\n\nSPEAKER_01: of course all of this will be available in the video description so for people watching just expand that and you'll find all of that there i highly encourage you to check it out and rebecca you've mentioned a lot of really great resources and books and so forth so we'll make sure to have a full list of all of those things linked below as well so if you're interested in learning more about any of these doctors or these books that rebecca has referenced that will be there and if you joined this video i've got a whole playlist of full recovery stories just like this one i'll link it up here it's just really moving really inspiring stuff and i learned something from every single one so i think yeah i'm just so grateful to people like yourself i'm grateful to you rebecca for doing this thank you so much for doing this today\n\nSPEAKER_00: oh it's so my pleasure likewise ray lynn thank you\n\nSPEAKER_01: and thank you to all of you who are watching i cannot believe the

hey guys having talked to over a hundred and seventy people already about their recovery from me cfs or long covid i've learned that while recovery definitely is possible it usually takes a while rapid recoveries are the exception but they are incredibly exciting when they do happen and today's interview is an example of just that hi everyone i'm ralan if you're new here welcome on this channel we explore recovery strategies and share real life stories every week to learn as much as we can from each other in fact these interviews are now part of a research study to discover what helps most people regain their health i'm super excited to have kelly with us today over in new york just four months after starting a recovery program she completed a ten k run and is now training for a full marathon so let's dive in and hear about her incredible journey and how she went from barely making it through the day to now running incredibly long distances kelly so great to have you here today thank you so much for being here and sharing your story yes thank you for having me so take us back you know to the beginning or before the beginning how did you how did this all start for you how did you start to notice that you something was off and you were well\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah so i typically am a very active person and i usually have a lot of energy to do different activities but there is a phase in my life where i just started to get really tired and i didn't have the motivation to go out and do as many activities and so i just started to notice things like laying in bed i would get these canker sores and just overall not feeling the best\n\nSPEAKER_00: and did you go to see a doctor what did you think was happening\n\nSPEAKER_01: i did go get my blood work done i thought maybe it was low iron or my electrolytes but my blood work came out pretty good and i thought maybe it was something mentally that was causing this\n\nSPEAKER_00: and what made you think that\n\nSPEAKER_01: just because i went to multiple doctors and they all said the same thing that everything was perfectly fine for my vitals my blood work but still i was getting lightheaded when i was standing up i didn't have as much focus during the day and the worst symptom was the mouth sores which i thought maybe had to do with me not handling my stress well\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay so it sounds like the doctors essentially sent you away with nothing and you were left to figure this out on your own so what did you do from there\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i heard about this program i can thrive and i was referred to the program by a family member and so i went to therapist before this to try to figure out some skills but none of them were as helpful as this program that i started to use\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay i've had jason on the channel before that's jason mctiernan's program correct i can thrive yeah i've interviewed a lot of people actually on the channel who have gone through his program and have recovered and interviewed him himself he's a great guy so what was it like going through the program for you and how did you find how do you think that it helped you to get past this and get where you are now\n\nSPEAKER_01: in the beginning i was a little skeptical because the program does have like a hypnosis type of effect in it where you're going through and imagining yourself at ease in a situation and trying to bring that into the future so i never really had that type of technique but once i really committed to learning the program it really made a difference and i could use all these little techniques in situations when i'm by myself such as like when i was driving in the car i get anxious and you really train your brain to think differently\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it is the whole program is based around i know a big component of it is this brain retraining piece which so many people are finding incredibly helpful with their journey had you heard of anything like this before you started doing this\n\nSPEAKER_01: i heard of going to a hypnotist which i never went to but i know some people like that i also heard of the emdr techniques for therapy so i movement desensitization and reprocessing but i never really tried his method\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just i asked because it can be a different way of thinking about healing than we usually do when our doctors tell us from what we grew up hearing about how you get well typically some sort of medication or surgery or something so to work with your brain to heal your body is a completely paradigm shift that we're in right now understanding healing and symptoms so once you started doing the program how quickly did you start to see progress\n\nSPEAKER_01: i started to see it maybe two weeks after it was pretty quick and compared to some other cases i know jason said that mine was a quicker recovery but yeah it really changed within six months i was back to feeling fully well\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow and since then you're even running ten k races can you tell us about that and what did that feel like\n\nSPEAKER_01: that was great my first ten k that i ran that year it was just motivating me to get back out there and challenge my body with physical activities right now i'm training for a full marathon with some of my friends and before i don't think i would have had the mental stamina to do that and now i just have that positive affirmations and changing the way of my mindset from fix to growth and it really has made a difference\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah going through these things does seem to transform people it's a horrible thing to go through but thankfully there's a lot of good that comes out of it do you have you noticed other changes within yourself for how you live your life now versus before you went through this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i definitely think that i am more eager to surround myself with people who have the growth mindset that they want to continue to challenge themselves and get better i also use a lot more of empowering statements where i didn't realize that saying like i am anxious is disempowering but instead you could say i am on my way to getting better and that's more of a journey rather than oh i'm stuck at this state of anxiety so definitely having those skills to keep positivity in my mind has helped my progress\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it sounds like you took a lot away from the i can thrive program although it's meant for cfs and long covid and similar conditions recovery but like a lot of programs or like a lot of things that we do you learn a lot of tools that end up serving you in life past this and beyond this yeah so when you're going through the program if someone's watching it and they are thinking oh this might be a good fit for me what does it look like to actually do the program can you tell us what an average day or week looks like\n\nSPEAKER_01: sure so in the beginning you'll start to meet with jason more frequently and he will guide you through the meditating process you also have access to the resources so there's online videos that he'll send you i think one of the best parts of this program is how personable jason is so i would get text messages randomly and throughout my recovery saying i just climbed a mountain i know you can do it you're doing great and it's just great having someone who believes in you that much even though we were complete strangers and the program focuses on like you said heavy resources so we would do our coaching sessions i would watch the videos he would recommend audio books and he'd give you free copies over email and just pointing you to different authors that have similar experiences so you see that the evidence is out there that this program's working\n\nSPEAKER_00: amazing and are you do you feel fully past this now is this officially behind you\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think there's still some days where i do feel very tired but i have now these tools to fix that so obviously you know life is stressful i'm still going to have some anxious moments but i can refocus and use these tools to pass it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think that's a really good answer because i mean the question itself really you know what does it mean to be fully recovered and fully past this if anyone ever really you know because these are things that were happening in our brain and our nervous system and you know trying to send us signals and alarms and we want those things to keep working so we're going to keep going to keep having symptoms and different things in our lives to let us know what's going on i guess the great thing is is that we walk away feeling not scared of that because if something does pop up like okay i've got the tools i know what to do i can get past it yeah so for you have anything that you'd want to say to people who are watching right now who are still on their journey maybe feeling a little bit lost or hopeless or anything that you'd say to yourself if you could go back during those times\n\nSPEAKER_01: i would definitely validate what you're feeling even if you haven't found any doctors or any social support that has the same experience there are people out there who have these product fatigue syndromes whatever they're facing and this program truly could help all you need really is to be pointed to the right resources and you know just like jason he'll always tell you that you got this and it's a journey so can't just keep comparing yourself to where you've been like you're on the right path to recovery\n\nSPEAKER_00: amazing well i'm so so happy for you kelly this is incredible i'm happy you connected with jason and yeah wishing you just amazing things from here i appreciate you taking the time to tell your story i know it will mean a lot to people to hear it it's always great to see that hope on the other side and that you can turn things around quite quickly sometimes sounds like yours is you know i always say radical success is the exception not the norm so you know don't want people watching to feel discouraged if their recovery doesn't happen in two weeks i know overall it took longer than that a few months for you guys yeah it is just really encouraging to see that you can turn things around and sometimes really quite quickly so yeah thank you so much for doing this today i really appreciate it kelly yeah thank you for those of you watching looking forward to your comments as always and i will link up here if you're interested in learning more about jason mctiernan and his program i can thrive we'll put a video here to help you get a better sense of what that's all about so yeah thank you again kelly thank you to those of you watching i hope you enjoyed this video i hope you got something out of it and i hope to see you in this next one here\n\nSPEAKER_01: thanks

what percentage of chronic debilitating symptoms are alleviated with surgery or medication\n\nSPEAKER_01: so surgery symptom the biggest factor keeping people in pain is anger but i thought anxiety and anger were psychological constructs it turns out it's just the sensations generated by your body when you're in fight or flight so i could most of our practice in two thousand and nineteen because i was so frustrated seeing so many people badly damaged by spine surgery i'm seeing so many people go to pain free with minimal cost no risk process\n\nSPEAKER_00: if you or someone you care about is struggling with long covid or me cfs you are in the right place and you're about to hear one of the most eye opening and information packed conversations in the chronic illness space today we're diving into what's actually driving chronic symptoms not just physically but mentally and emotionally and spoiler although it's not all in your head which we always knew it is deeply wired into your nervous system through something we'll be exploring right now called threat physiology if you're new here i'm raylan eagle and the conversations you will find here are like no other in the chronic illness space because we explore all paths to recovery if it helps people heal we talk about it the goal is to learn together and help each other find a way out and today i'm thrilled to be joined by the incredible dr david hanscom he spent over thirty years as a complex spine surgeon until he realized he had to walk away from the operating room to help people truly heal from chronic pain and his own fifteen year journey with pain and many other symptoms led him to an unexpected discovery anxiety looping thoughts and unconscious stress patterns were actually at the root and once he addressed those he finally fully recovered and now he teaches how to shift from threat to safety physiology interrupt repetitive unwanted thoughts and work with the unconscious brain where most pain actually begins and according to him and so many other respected professionals in this field this approach works not just for chronic pain but also for anxiety depression and yes even me cfs and long covid so if you're stuck in fear loops if your body feels like it's always on high alert or if you're just exhausted from being told that there's nothing wrong with you when you know that something is my heart goes out to you and this conversation is absolutely for you so let's dive in dr hanscom wonderful to have you here thanks for doing this yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: thank you i'm excited to be here\n\nSPEAKER_00: oh my goodness such a vast amount of knowledge and experience you have on this topic i can't wait to get into all of this i'm sure people would love to hear a little bit before we get into the details of all of this just your journey how did you end up doing this work that you were doing what's your experience been leading up to today\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i'll try to keep this story relatively short but basically practice complex deformity surgery in seattle washington for about thirty two years and about four years four years into my practice around nine hundred ninety i was in seattle right across the five twenty bridge and at the time you know i was in my practice i was a young gun you know just going after it hard and i didn't didn't even know what the word anxiety was you know become a major spice or by having an anxiety and also in the five twenty bridge in seattle i had a panic attack what is this and i look it up i didn't know what it was and you know it's basically just regulated nervous system it's an ultimate anxiety reaction and from that point on for the next thirteen or fourteen years i cannot come out of this hole so i develop seventeen different symptoms of migraine headaches itching scalp skin rashes back pain neck pain can sleep ring in my ears and my whole nervous system sort of fell apart but nobody could tell me what was going on so part of it i went to counseling for like thirteen years psychotherapy trying to figure this out and things got even worse and it wasn't till two thousand two thousand and three things get extremely bad that it sounds odd but sort of gave up fighting i didn't know what else to do and inadvertently as you're not certain turned out sort of to be the answer because we're eventually learned that with the brain be so neuroplastic whatever you're fighting and trying to fix actually becomes reinforced thirteen psychotherapy which actually reinforcing the pain circuits not help them so bottom line is i q out of my also symptoms around two thousand and four and i've been pretty much symptom free for over twenty years and i never thought this past never thought this was possible and i came i went into it by accident i came out of play accident it to me about twenty years to figure out what happened the last five years who form a scientific international study group that she goes into the science of chronic illness and now i actually know it figured it out has been about a thirty five year quest to figure out what happened to me that day on the bridge\n\nSPEAKER_00: and from all of your learning from what happened to you how does this tie into your work as the spinal surgery and how you then proceeded to approach treating patients\n\nSPEAKER_01: was starting out interim medicine so he's to be has sort of a whole person approach right from the beginning so i always see a piece a few times before surgery or to make sure they get physical therapy medications etc still a pretty aggressive surgeon but a lot of the surgeries weren't working very well so seattle at the time i was there between run nineteen eighty six to nine hundred ninety five was doing nine times the rate of spine fusion per capita as any place else in the country and so i was part of that team i was enthusiastic i feel guilty if i cannot find a reason to do surgery and i started to think what i did but basically turns out we are operating on normally aging spines the success rate of doing a spine fusion back pain is about twenty percent is a big operation and i thought it was like ninety percent but i knew my results were as good as i wanted to one of them to be and my got mine up to about forty five percent but it was because of the surgery is because of the rehab so ninety ninety three in that paper came out i just quit doing surgery for back pain but i didn't know what to do so meantime i spiral into this deep hole of chronic pain and multiple symptoms and so i just sort of did the best i could not operate in nine hundred ninety nine i moved to sunny idaho in a private practice sole practice and i didn't have any resources so i started doing everything by myself and i knew that there are some tools that work in long story short i took a surgeon's approach to non operative care surgeons if you address sleep is number one people weren't sleeping we found out that lack of sleep out of study in israel so that lack of sleep actually causes chronicle back pain not the way around sure goes interesting so hard but the data also showed only five percent of surgeons were five in a physicians were actually addressing sleep so i started doing that i handed a little book called feeling good but david burns which is cognitive behavioral therapy i did have a psychologist and then david started to do some expressive writing so we started that people started getting better always to get physical therapy and rehab so that was in place i was still as medications and then would you not really in a clear way was life outlook so is jumping ahead twenty years it turned out that the biggest factor keeping people in pain is anger but i thought anxiety and anger were psychological construct in turns out it's just the sensations generated by your body when you're in fight or flight so you feel anxious your body says danger show you your fight or flight response starting if you can't solve the danger you can more a fight or flight response and you become angry so turned out anger and anxiety are physiological survival responses that we have no control over zero in a for my bruce lipton who is the author of the book biology believe put out really clearly we have zero control out of anxiety and anger and we now call it threat physiology and so anxiety is active physiology anger is hyperactivity through physiology and the problem with physiology your entire system fires up so your neurotransmitters in the brain go from calming to start a tory your stress hormones of course kick in place there's a little molecule in the bottle called cytokines as you all know little molecules that go from such from cell to cell there's inflammatory ones in profile tory ones in under fight or flight your entire immune system lights up and then cortisol drains fuel out of your body it's been known for fifty years that chronic stress breaks down the body i e chronic fighter flight so any athlete has to train then rest in order to regenerate if you're in constant stress fight or flight your body breaks down it turns out that every chronic disease with few exceptions are related to chronic stress that's mental and physical diseases so turned out the anxiety depression bipolar o c d and schizophrenia are basically metabolic inflammatory disorders really so critical is that this physiological response is about you know half a million times stronger than your conscious brain so your conscious brain unconscious brain processes about eleven million bits of information per second take us how much your process your conscious brain processes\n\nSPEAKER_00: i couldn't begin to imagine\n\nSPEAKER_01: forty so what were happening when you're in fight or flight your highest thinking party or brain the neocortex doesn't work so when you're running from a tiger you know thinking about philosophy in the human cortex is so big compared to other mammals that when the blood supply drops down in that part of the brain it really drops down and your thinking centers are markedly compromised and you're just reacting you're not really thinking and so says so much stronger than your conscious brain will use conscious control or conscious interventions or try to counteract that it's a mismatch you cannot do it\n\nSPEAKER_00: this is fascinating i am so excited to hear you explaining all of this is so validating or us going through this to hear this coming from a physician from a surgeon from you know medical a scientific perspective because it can all sound a little bit that oh you're in all this pain you're you have a world of symptoms and you have to look at your emotions and you know this is your path out of this so i'm wondering how many other doctors in your experience are aware of this approach to healing in the in the latest science and embrace it and use it\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i would say some i see very few surgeons i would say very very few surgeons and i was helping hundreds of patients literally go to pain free so my symptoms are gone and i fight out the science behind this and so i translated it into a book and a website no of course where people systematically go through learn the tools to calm the physiology and reroute it reroute the nervous system in the pain results and it happens hundreds and hundreds of times so i'm watching people being badly damaged by spine surgery with very expensive long term i mean really devastating results from best i surgery i was a guy who was trying to clean up the mess and it wasn't solvable most the time so i get somebody before they had any surgery at all it was just magical i can tell you some stories in a second but the bottom line is that's very self directed and i don't think as you go too much in the details of the course now because the idea is it's about learning skills so what's evolved in the last couple years is that the body knows how to heal you know sort of a trice saying but it's really true is in threat physiology your body breaks down right it was if you sustain it really breaks down and then weight lifters lifting weight he or she has to rest for the most muscles to go back up there was overtraining actually breaks your body down they think if your body's in constant fight or flight your body's going to break down so what happens is always through physiology again physiology is how the body functions in their city physiology with body rest regeneration heals so some ratio of enough safety compared to threat the body heals itself so the healing that occurs is far beyond what i can do is far beyond a self help process and not only do people go to pain free usually all the symptoms resolve and they thrive in a little possible that happens over in over and over again so i could most of practice in two thousand and nineteen because so frustrated seeing so many people badly damaged by spice or three and seen so many people go to pain free with minimal cost no risk self directed process you do not need a pain clinic to do this i said i had to quit so that was in two thousand nineteen i have not made nearly as much progress as i thought it would but all the medical fish is flat out digging in his heels that's a long answer to that question there is not buying it and the thing they ranch for a second we learn this in college actually learns in high school is the physiology class right temperature blood pressure heart rate all these things are in physiology class in college a little bit more in medical school we learned about the human body at a very very deep level and the physiology is where it happens because the body functions with physiology becomes ill when it dysfunctions so we're focused on structure and so the problem is we're just called medically unexplained symptoms by chance m u s sounds familiar well started out in two thousand and two in the failure practice literature you say well we know you've all these symptoms we kind of we can't find a source we call it medically unexplained symptoms was it terrible diagnosis because people give up hope ok they know it's going on there does the idea of the diagnosis was to acknowledge the fact that you hurt which is a start and we nothing we can do but can help you cope with it so that's wrong if we look at the physiology of stress and again stress is the problem coming in going to fight or flight because of stresses and threats you look at this is physiology of sustained stress everything is explained every single symptom i had is gone how can that be every cell in the body's bath in this chemical environment you know different organ systems have different functions so i migraine headaches they're gone but what happens is that the blood vessels of the brain get inflamed transmitters neurotransmitters are off and when you really regulate your physiology back to safety that goes away my ears were ringing tinnitus for many many years twenty five years i thought from construction work days and i do have some hearing loss it's gone is a renda symptom sounds sort of mild but the chronic really bothers you it's gone and the reason for that again i can theorize on it but it's gone lots of people in my course have had the tennis disappear but again fight or flight your nervous self has inflammatory cells your brain your brain itself is inflate so it takes less stress to set off this the sensations than the nerve connection in your body doubles so you have a hyperactive ear and receptive system in your ears ring my feet would burn like crazy especially at night that's gone skin rashes would pop up over my body that's gone and back pain neck pain that's gone so you say well how can that be physiology covers every cell in the body and if you come physiology all the symptoms disappear one person twenty four symptoms gone another gentleman had twenty surgeries and twenty nine surgeries in twenty years and his suffered it was just a huge mess of his life and he started work with my stuff about ten years ago and in about a year who pain free and ten years later he's living the best life of his entire life that's after twenty eight surgery there's two parts to healing one of them is to learn to your survival physiology is keeping you alive it's a gift so anxiety anger are gifts i mean how you survive without anger and anxiety we would not so you learn to separate your identity from these stress reactions is we take your identity in we take your stress reaction which are intended to be very unpleasant you take them personally you don't feel good and a lot of mental energy trying to compensate for this bad feelings was supposed to be bad so as you separate denny from the stress reactions and say look just take a thermometer visually on the other on the opposite wall and we feel really anxious angry and frustrated just visualize how high this morris going in you should use the tools to drop it down and so that's one part of it the other half is nurturing joy so again you can nurture joy if you're fighting stress not possible you can think you are in trying to distract yourself but it's such a mismatch it never works but if you try to run your pain stress physiology yes you reinforce it so we call it self induced deep healing as if you train your brain is a trained learned skills non positive thinking by the way which is another disaster but you sort of train your brain to be less reactive to the pain issue training to be less reactive is when you fight it you really reinforce the circuits we talk about it he reinforces circuits so you learn a common physiology and then when you're on then you do what you want to do so the healing actually occurs as you start living your life on your terms not by fighting the pain so i have little saying is quit fighting darkness and just turn on the light so it's a bit more complicated that but not much and i'll just be one example to one model here so we can maybe go on the the mental part of the conversation as far as these repetitive thought patterns but you know we came up with a model called dynamic healing so every living creature has sensory sceptors that takes input from the environment whatever environment that is you have the century input touch sound sight feel all these different sensations so those come into your nervous system and so you have your input your nervous system which processes all this and you have your output which is the physiology either threat or safety so there's ways of process your stresses differently so they have less impact on your nervous system there's ways of making nervous system going from hyper reactive to call and there is a physiology there's things you can dress lee learn the physiology on the input side of the good the goal is just more safety physiology so all these interventions come towards one goal so it's never one intervention solves a problem is a combination of just a life using different tools in your times of the day to calm down your physiology so for instance which you want to sample is if you're my office and you have chronic pain as you look when you walk in the office you'll never discuss your pain ever with anybody and because what's as input was input doing your physiology right so it is a bit deeper than there is just your physiology i'm sure never discuss your pain or discussion medical care no complaining no criticism giving unasked for advice and no gossip because what's it doing to your physiology right so that's one of the basic cardinal rules are simply no negativity and often we sure in some workshops back east those were a carnival rolls and it takes about six weeks actually slow that down because we all like to complain this is where we are and it's for hard especially the gossip part of people used to gossiping but it again fires a breath of physiology especially when you're in pain you are complaining about the doctors medical system there's illnesses you complain about when you're in pain and the are legitimate complaint but you want you do you want your brain on the problem or do you want to solution so this one example how we work on input for output for instance you probably have done this a lot with your clients where you do breath work like slow breathing stimulus was called the biggest nerve which is anti inflammatory or rubbing your forehead stimulates the fifth cranial nerve i'm sure the same fifth grain or in the forehead i actually took that little tool for my cat so i can call my cat down really quickly by rubbing her forehead so also sound there's some pitches of music that really stimulate the biggest nerve and actually causing to calm down issue lower the physiology is for is the nervous system itself you make it more resilient was sleep is number one you have to sleep diet you know to find her diet and exercise are the three big ones as far as the nervous system so your sister be call or hyperactive and sometimes you come from an abusive environment or system to be feel safe so i taking a feral cat and try to calm it down you can't talk to it you said to teach it how to feel safe so that's where the dynamic healing you have your input or stresses your nervous system or copy skills you have your physiology the output and we have threat physiology then you have symptoms so the root cause the root cause of illness is interaction between your stresses in your coping skills so we're treating only the symptoms so the root causes and we close being address so it's like trying to put on an oil well fire with a garden hose you know the fuel keeps coming up and you've got to go to the root cause by dealing with so when we teach people to learn these tools about ten or fifteen minutes a day that's it we try to really really learn about pain or really solve the problem you're actually reinforcing the pain here's learning tools that use every day all day long you should not be work because one of the end to those anxiety is play is you think sort of playful curious attitude towards it that really comes of the physiology that's whole different topic they were the bottom line is that in a killing motor you change the input you increase your nervous system learn to lower the threat physiology then the symptoms resolve themselves i covered a lot of ground there\n\nSPEAKER_00: i was just thinking i think you've covered everything that i've been working to cover on this channel since it started we might just shut down the channel after today this is i think a mic drop moment\n\nSPEAKER_00: you've explained it so incredibly well and light bulbs are just going off all over the place as even thinking with my own journey for my first couple of years i was really laid out and really symptomatic and then i decided for a year that i was going to stop trying to fix myself because i didn't know what else to do and i wasn't going to talk about it i made a rule because i was tired of it being my whole identity and it was interesting it wasn't the whole fix but in that year just by stop trying to fix it and never talking about it again i started to feel better\n\nSPEAKER_00: one of a zillion little you know light bulb moments that were going off for me as you're talking about i think though i mean preaching to the choir here as well as to you know a lot of the people that watch this channel are pretty right up and up to speed on the science behind this but still understandably many have not been given this information or are just hearing it for the first time and it sounds a little bit off because i still hear every day from people i have all these symptoms i'm really struggling to believe that i'm going to be able to get rid of them all without surgery or medication so what was you estimate what percentage of chronic debilitating symptoms are alleviated with surgery or medication\n\nSPEAKER_01: memory treating symptoms so surgery symptom and so my one pain of the body so to me a long time to figure this out so let's take back pain there is not operation should ever be done with back pain ever works the reason for that is first of all the same acute lumbar strain you strain your back and about half of people by the way this developing backstrain it goes on to be chronic so the m r i scans what happens there's a pain center in the brain lights up back pain in about six or twelve months actually shifts to the emotional center the same pain but a different driver is a definition of chronic pain is a embedded memory that becomes connected to more and more life experiences and the memory cannot be erased and it cannot these pain circuits are absolutely permanent is similar to phantom limb pain or leg is cut off here why is the pain still there the structures gone in so the brain if you think about this carefully every living creature to memorize everything all the time otherwise we don't stay alive you know when across the street we know we're not looking to the sun we know how to stay safe but your brain's taking it in if mission every second so which is really information it just ignores it because it's safe so the new comes up you have to analyze it but your brain memorizes everything but especially pain and so it sounds discouraging but he is the more you try to fight it and solve it the more you reinforce it so you really are going to get rid of these pain circuits you can walk through them you walk past them you can transcend but you can't fight them and so what you're doing is you learn to separate yourself from your pain in the first thing that happens by the way with mental pain and physical pain is that you change your relationship to the pain is the pain she or you're here\n\nSPEAKER_01: as you start getting on with your life the way you want to your terms that's the solution it's really is so from neuroplasticity standpoint by the way neuroplasticity i'm sure knows it we do not i didn't know this medical school i'm sure we even knew it back in medical school but your brain changes by the second we thought that the brain was static in sort of lost cells as you get older and it changes every millisecond so even right now both of our brains have changed and so what you're doing you're trying to direct the brain to change the direction she want and that's why if you start living life that you want and you quit fighting the old one that part of your old brain starts atrophy so the circuit is still there they can be triggered any time but they really attribute the point where they just don't bother anymore so it's consistent one example right now again i don't know if the eyes comprehensive depression o c d bipolar his metabolic inflammatory disorders they're not psychological so in zari is the term we use when you're fight or flight so it just describes humans have this description for fight or flight who calls it just a descriptive term is not a psychological diagnosis she learned to live with it be with it i don't like to embrace it but you do embrace it because it's part of keep you alive he just go on your way\n\nSPEAKER_00: we talk a lot here on the channel about the conscious brain and unconscious brain so what is the relationship between those two and why is it important to understand that when it comes to chronic conditions\n\nSPEAKER_01: well chronic disease is a state and dr navio at mitochondrial has shown that you have chronic illness is motor connect they don't heal she actually shift that state before you actually can move forward if you use an acute interventions for economic problem it doesn't work so what you're doing is learn how to calm down physiology and then move forward you know so the question was exactly what again\n\nSPEAKER_00: understand it we talk about some things happened in our unconscious brain and other things we happen in our conscious brain and we need to bring things from the unconscious to the conscious there i just i think it gets a bit confusing for people understanding the relationship between the two and you know how this relates to their symptoms and their recovery\n\nSPEAKER_01: so the unconscious brain keeps you alive we do not need conscious brain to stay alive so we use conscious brain you have to be careful because you know animals have consciousness also right our animals look at things analyzing decisions but they don't have thoughts they don't have language to put meaning to it so they still respond if we do not have a new cortex we still stay alive chimpanzees have ninety nine point nine percent of the d n a we do you have quite a bit of intellectual capacity but they don't have this huge neocortex so remember the unconscious brain is eleven million bits of your patient per second the conscious brain is forty that's it so you can't control it and so it's like trying to drag stir with handbrakes dr work with a conscious brain does it gives you the steering wheel you can steer and direct it wherever you want so your conscious brain will react to whatever you put into it again if you consciously decide to complain to be negative that's what's going to happen your conscious brain is respond to what you put into it so it's a forty bits of information per second eleven million you decide what you want to load into this thing if you're put loaded negative you have a massive survival reaction and so the other thing is that this is been also eight hundred which i'm really disturbed about his house on a couple weeks ago but if you see somebody dangerous walking across the street your body actually responds first before you have thoughts it's the actually physiology first so it's about a one to ten second delay your body automatically reacted by the time you think about it so let's have a thoughts for second new book on repetitive i wanted thoughts and so what i learned in my own experience is i have full blown obsessive compulsive disorder which is marked by really extreme intrusive thoughts and most people don't have that but just by definition the way the brain works and this is where i think humanity's going to come up this different solution for this is that your threat physiology creates unpleasant thought because what happens you're the conscious brain is interpreted the sensations made by your unconscious nervous system we call it intraception so if you're buying fight or flight your conscious brain gives different meanings to these sensations you know as an in the same or a negative words you know sad shame embarrass all these different things are meanings we give to a physiology so the way your brain is working is that your your physiology creates the unpleasant thoughts then the thoughts themselves become input that actually strikes up the physiology this very bi directional and so after a while with repetition the thoughts become embedded in different triggers always fire the physiology vice versa so if you're anxious frustrated for any reason you're from negative thoughts then the negative thoughts can also become their own input so this one part is by directional that's very unique to humans so we're through unwanted thoughts or rumination why ninety five percent people ninety five percent of people have these things about seventy percent of people have a lot of destruction lifestyle i had extreme form showing about two or three percent population of extreme intrusive thoughts really negative really negative with all the physical symptoms i had the two worst parts my deal were these repetitive thought patterns they were just horrible so by the way is also direct relationship between thoughts and suicide actually attempted suicide miss whole thing and what drove me to that was the thoughts they just would not stop so i noticed over the years of people's pain would disappear their anxiety would drop and these thought patterns spinning away so forcefully my experience they actually disappeared they're gone but i could figure out why and so you have to understand is that there's a four part process when these thoughts so the miracle i just start with is that of a hornet's nest where the nest river is your system or your brain in the horse or your thoughts you know somebody shakes the nest the hornets are pretty unhappy is what we're doing right side fighting these hornets which is making them more angry the real interest which shaking the nest so the four parts of solving this pattern says number one separate from the thoughts that's where my friend is conducted behavior therapy comes into play if you heard six size call expressive writing if you work with that much so that separates you from the thoughts not solving them to say thought separation process and then the nervous system so the first of a separate from your thoughts calm physiology the third part destroy i mean dissolve your ego and the fourth partner plasticity so thought separations of first part where you learn to express and look at him mindfulness is the same thing you simply the thoughts are here you're here in common physiology is a stylish healing model we change the input the nervous system the output and what you're doing is mostly around anger so people are angry about a lot of things they always have been particular this day and age with a lot of sensory input we're overwhelmed or frustrated we feel trapped and when you're angry your nervous system is really fired up so there's a bunch of tools i call it anger processing to calm things down is sort of beyond the scope of this discussion but calm physiology does actually critical so physiology drives the thoughts in medicine we're not addressing the physiology so do it in the summer of carnita processes to deal with these thoughts in not even the root cause at all the third part which made you know just go for this discussion that we develop an ego for a couple reasons one of them is our stress physiology is unpleasant it's just feel bad so we develop this story about ourselves to feel better about ourselves second of all we're mostly programmed by negativity right\n\nSPEAKER_01: we're raised by criticism do this do this should do this shouldn't do that so we're sort of programmed through our lifetime with negativity so we develop our own internal story about ourselves to feel better and then the third reason is we're competitive species like every other creature so we want to look good so we spend a lot of time building up this appearance to other people but also to ourselves to look good it takes a lot of mental energy to do that so on top of that we suppress negativity so the suppressed thoughts emotion really fire up this whole process or ruts and then it develops into mental what's called mental rigidity which is cemented in my anger is this really fixed view of yourself it's not solvable that's where conspiracy theories come into a big play with these thoughts about life in general that this and this so rigid thinking is a huge block to healing is a huge block to treatment you get a certain mindset and it's not so it's not changeable so that's the challenge we deal with now is if you're open to actually engaging people heal but the key issue is people don't believe it you mentioned earlier well what if you talk about this people don't buy into it well it's a problem so i ask people don't believe me so when you leave this podcast or tv show don't believe anything i said the key is connect to what's in there which is skepticism so i said you don't have to believe anything and david hanscom or the process or whatever it is believe that your body knows how to heal so connecting with what is is a huge factor so connect with your skepticism is actually the starting point you start doing the work now letting your brain start to change then the fourth part where the healing actually occurs we talked about this before you separate from your physiology over here because you nurture joy good food good wine good friends your brain develops that direction that's the definitive healing it's not by fixing the negative side it's by nurturing the good side so with these thought patterns you got your thought separation call the physiology the driving force the third thing which has to happen relatively quickly is kill your ego you don't need it you understand your three physiologies over here you're not taking it personally you don't need an ego it's a ways to think about it so think how much time we spend with me being king of this how much time we spend build up an appearance that we think is okay so that takes mental energy that my cat doesn't spend time with so you know she just gets what she wants anyway so she doesn't need an ego\n\nSPEAKER_00: so that goes so i'm thinking about the people listening watching and i think there's a tendency for people to think i'm somehow going to be the one person that this doesn't apply to so for people who learn what this is about who implement strategies who follow this course of moving forward i mean what percentage of people would you estimate that this could be beneficial for for people with these chronic symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i'll tell you that i don't know all i know that depends on this repetition so it depends how committed you are to learning the skills the focus is on the skills not believing so usually calm your physiology and let your body heal the hardest part of this project by far is people can't help but try to fix themselves and when you do that of course your attention's on the problem so we learn to be with the problem and then move a different direction so if people engage is a high percentage heal but it may take a week usually obviously being three to six months of repetition is a key issue here and it takes a while to learn how to play the piano learn how to become a professional at anything and people might say well i don't want to become a professional oh really i mean you basically become a professional at life skills so we're not being the highest level professional learn how to rig your physiology so i'll just give you one example i mean i have a lot of people in there the thought patterns are a little bit something i'm learning i mean it's really tough to break through these thought patterns as far as the pain and anxiety that can drop down relatively quickly i'm on a learning curve as far as the thought patterns but one gentleman who i saw a couple months ago he's a friend of a friend now i'm not in clinical practice so i can give guidance so he was having surgery recommended a normal spine who's like a long spine fusion international he was suicidally depressed so the data has shown forever again the whole process evolved of just just by trying to follow the research about what we're supposed to do so none of this is something i made up or invented or some magic formula is just following the science so the data even if i didn't know any of those clear back forty years ago you don't operate on people that are suicidally depressed you just don't do that well that's being done all the time now and so that operation in that circumstance would have put him in and this is what it would show my practice so it started the process that i'm working on about six weeks ago i talked to a couple days ago his mood is way better depression is lifted he's not suicidal the pain is still there but he doesn't react so much which is always the first thing with pain that is there doesn't bother you as much eventually as you keep going different direction informing new circuits in your brain those new circuits don't have pain so people do go to pain free and it's better repetition and learning tools but again we call it deep self induced healing if you allow your body be a state of physiology your body heals itself so this might be confusing but i'm going to try anyway there's a concept of self help versus deep healing so self help helps symptoms and if you contribute contributed to healing but the idea of self help is i want to learn enough tools i want to be really good about processing pain because i want less pain the pain of the show so inadvertently self help processes tend to reinforce chronic pain so deep healing is learning to not react to the pain be with the pain and then go a different direction so letting go the fixing process is really challenging that's probably the biggest step is letting go\n\nSPEAKER_00: this is incredible i'm just thinking this is a lot of information for people watching listening so if you're feeling like i think maybe i retained ten percent of that don't worry watch it again i'm already thinking i'm going to have to go back and replay this and i'm wondering what resources what information what do you have available for people who want to learn more about this from you and get some support on their journey\n\nSPEAKER_01: so all my resources are on my website back in control com one word and then on the front page there there's a lot of resources we put up some books which really just nice summaries of the situation just to really a simple start to it i have a book back in control a surgery on a chronic pain and then i have a course called the doc journey direct your own care journey it's a computer based course and i recommend people spend maybe about ten or twenty minutes a day on it that's it it shouldn't be work should be curiosity what's going on look at it as just learning skills it's very self directed then i coach twice a week and tuesdays and thursdays at noon on a zoom call and so the coaching myself is not effective if you add the coaching to the course is very effective and so then i have all sorts of videos and blogs and probably too much stuff on the website but the core between the flip books the course the coaching is sort of in the book back in control get you started on what you're going to do incredible yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay well make sure to have that all linked in the video description so people could check it out because you have hit the nail on the head for that all the key things that the experts that i bring on this channel talk about and explained it just also concisely so for people watching listening to yourself a favor take a moment look at some of those links because you know he's got the experience the knowledge and clearly a wonderful person so some really great resources there to make use of on your journey and i'm also going to link if you're watching this and this is resonating i did another interview with dr howard schubner you might be aware of so i'll link that up on the screen as well if people want to check that out it's just really incredible and really validating to have so many knowledgeable physicians coming forward and speaking about this and just validating the experiences of people going through this because for many years so many of us felt lost and or told it was all in our head or we were just being lazy or maybe making it up so this is impact just not only the validation but also tools a path forward you can get better\n\nSPEAKER_01: howard schumer is a good friend of mine he's my mentor oh and we play golf together we stay each other's houses and stuff so he's wonderful he's very academic he keeps doing the research on it and he's really really wonderful\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah he i've only interviewed him the one time but i just thought the world of him and he is another one who is just really changing so many people's lives it's it's incredible the work that people like yourself and him are doing thank you so much for being here i really appreciate this every sentence of this has been gold truly valuable i really appreciate it dr\n\nSPEAKER_01: thank you i really enjoyed our time\n\nSPEAKER_00: thanks to everyone for watching and listening and hope to see you in this next also incredibly information packed interview with dr howard

do you know which book has been mentioned as the most helpful for recovery in the one hundred and fifty five recovery interviews i've conducted so far if you've listened to even a few you can probably guess what book that is it's become such a phenomenon that there's even a term for it doctors call it book recoveries you read a book almost always this one specific book and you recover if you're new here welcome i'm raylan and don't worry in this video we're going to tell you what book that is each week here on the channel we dive deep into new recovery journeys from chronic conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome and long haul covid so we as a community can get inspired and learn from each other this famous book i mentioned changed everything for my guest today dr doug goufrida from the university of rochester after years of seemingly random unconnected health issues and unbearable back pain that he was told required surgery the information in this book didn't just help him avoid surgery and fully heal it also steered his career towards a whole new kind of research he now trains doctors to implement the same recovery strategies that have been so effective for him and so many others doug it was so great to have you here today thanks for doing this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah thank you thank you for having me\n\nSPEAKER_00: so you have had quite the journey with chronic pain and all of this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah sure so like a lot of providers i got into this because of my own chronic pain i had back pain i had a herniated disc with you know shown on an mri couldn't sit down for a year it was extreme pain and was going to get surgery while i waited for surgery i found a book by a guy named john sono a lot of i think a lot of your readers or viewers are familiar with and read the book found a therapist to do some of the harder work and my back pain was gone within a few months went back to all my activities play basketball sports and not only that but a lot of the other health problems i had suffered with for years went away i had arthritic knee i had what nowadays would be called ibs i think that was probably before that diagnosis existed this was over twenty years ago shoulder pain\n\nSPEAKER_01: headaches i mean you name it i had all kinds of stuff that you know one would go away and the other would come back i actually had heartburn so bad i had surgery for acid reflux which i wish i never had now because i clearly didn't need it causes problems for me now but yeah so everything went away i didn't do much with it as a practitioner i'm a counselor but i didn't do chronic pain counseling in fact we didn't talk about it much with anyone because back then you know you talk about it with people they think you were nuts to say that something physical could be cured something psychological and so i whisper to people in the shadows about you should try this book but didn't do much with it and then a few years ago i took an administrative role at my university and it was one that was a very stressful i wasn't enjoying it and my back pain came back and so i had a conversation with my supervisor at that point to say look i can't do this back hurting it's clearly bothering me for a while she had a hard time letting me out of the role and finally she said okay fine don't want to do this what do you want to do then and i said well i want to do chronic pain counseling and it wasn't my area i had been studying how to keep kids in college that was my college retention and she said well great we have a medical center here if you want to learn something new you can find someone i'll actually support you to do a fellowship and so she supported me i found the fellowship at the university who does this work with people with seizures bill watson who's a psychologist who works in the department of neurology he opened me up to the whole world of what we'll talk about later which is istp focused therapy bill uses this with seizure patients about forty percent of seizures are not epileptic meaning there's no chemical activity in the brain indicating any seizures and they're what's called psychogenic seizures and they use the same emotion focused approach i'll talk about to cure people of psychogenic seizures so i studied with bill i got to learn from a guy named howard schumer who some of your listeners are probably familiar with alan abbas is another big person in this field did a lot of my own work learning it engaging in it did what's called core training and istdp which is a pretty intensive\n\nSPEAKER_01: three year training approach with a local expert named marvin scorman and then opened my whole private practice\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow and just try even i'm still stuck on the point where they were telling you that you needed surgery because your chronic pain back pain and leg pain had been quite severe\n\nSPEAKER_01: i couldn't sit down i couldn't move i would be locked up on the floor for you know sometimes hours at a time i got out of my car once at work and dropped to the ground couldn't get up for i don't know a couple hours in the parking lot i mean it was severe and you know there was visual evidence to indicate there was a structural problem now what we know now is that's all pretty much nonsense my back looked the same before it hurt it probably looks the same now you know there's quite a bit of research supporting the fact that back shoulders knees change as we age they look different just like hair turns gray our backs get narrow separate show little cracks they don't that doesn't cause pain just like gray hair doesn't hurt it's a psychological problem there's quite a bit of evidence now indicating there's really no very little relationship between observed structural changes back almost everybody you probably show herniated disc most people over the age of thirty show one of these things that would be diagnosable but don't have\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it's interesting our understanding of chronic pain now because we used to think not so long ago well if there's no structural damage maybe this is a psychogenic thing but now we're seeing that there's very little correlation between the level of structural damage and the pain that you're experiencing or that the pain being an indication of a level of structural damage they just really aren't\n\nSPEAKER_01: radiologists can't tell from looking at images who has pain which should be pretty clear cut but it's not\n\nSPEAKER_00: so when you read dr john sarno's book what was it from the book that was resonating for you and making you think okay this might be what's happening for me\n\nSPEAKER_01: well the symptoms right the fact that i had always had something really since i was a kid stomach problems headaches digestive problems you know sleep problems it was always something one would go away and the other one so you just find this carousel specialists that are just looking at one particular body part that really resonated the personality characteristics i don't know if you're familiar with some of the things sorrow talked about but they're they're so true for me most of my clients that i see really highly motivated ambitious hardworking but also really uncomfortable with strong emotions we're the people that run around trying to make everyone feel better we don't like it when people get upset you know we can have a party and everybody has a great time but if one person is unhappy we're really upset about that those kinds of things\n\nSPEAKER_00: i know a lot of people watching will be familiar with the book and have heard about it but many won't have read it so the approach to treating this what does that look like from that perspective\n\nSPEAKER_01: well sorrow said that a lot of people could get better just by reading the book and i know you mentioned in one of your interviews with the fact folks talk to you about that too just the idea that it resonates with it this isn't a structural problem there's nothing wrong with physically i just have to get in touch with my emotions you know learn to not be afraid of things and engage in things in more gradual persistent way he said about eighty percent of his patients got better just doing that i wasn't one of them and a number of us the people that i see usually are you know they have read it they're familiar with it that's why they find me but they're still struggling and so what we engage with now is a process called tensive short term dynamic psychotherapy i do some of the other things that i think your viewers are probably familiar with brain reprocessing pain neuroscience education i think those are some of the buzzwords that i definitely use those tools but for me the core of the intervention is this emotion focused approach the idea is all emotions are healthy we're born emotional human beings with this whole range of really intense feelings that need to be there for us to transition\n\nSPEAKER_01: even things that we consider negative emotions grief loss intense anger and rage you know those things are all helpful to us to mobilize us to advocate ourselves but we learn early on often from our caregivers that some emotions are okay healthy and some emotions are really problematic and even dangerous and so we develop strategies sometimes even before we even can talk to adapt to our environment to protect ourselves and others from these emotions that we learn are not okay so we are born the most helpless creatures on the planet right if you watch a horse born you know they jump up and run away right babies are completely helpless our human babies are our entire existence depends upon between us and our caregiver and so we learn to adapt ourselves to fit in that environment to get the care sometimes this can happen where parents are ragers angry painful see all this fighting can come because of abuse but more often than not it can come because really good parents just are really uncomfortable with the fits that a kid throws or the range of emotions that a kid might show probably a lot of people have seen the disease movie inside out it's just a beautiful depiction of really good parents and teach a kid that where's my happy girl and you can't be upset put a smile on that kind of thing and so we learn to disconnect from these emotions to sit with the needs of our environment and we develop strategies to ward off these uncomfortable or dangerous emotions one of the strategies can be varied but for chronic pain patients it tends to be physical pain parents who might not be adapted handling their anger their rage fits become very mobilized when they have a stomach ache or a headache or hurt themselves and they learn this and so subconsciously we're able to transform this physical or these emotions into physical form there's actually quite a bit of mri research that supports this process which is really quite amazing that we're sort of supporting the things from you know the eighteen hundreds now mri research with people chronic pain versus acute pain looks very very different acute pain which they'll put someone in an mri kind of apply heat to their finger in a way that doesn't hurt the finger but hurts a lot you see the brain lights up there's not one pain center like there is an emotional visual cortex or auditory cortex it sort of lights up all over across the brain but you put people with back pain for example\n\nSPEAKER_01: their brains light up one little teeny place called\n\nSPEAKER_01: you might guess what the amygdala does if you're not familiar it's part of us responsible for emotions anger rage\n\nSPEAKER_01: it looks very different so science is actually backing up the idea emotions can be transformed physical form\n\nSPEAKER_00: and we know all this now and we can have these conversations but with your experience because he said you know back then you couldn't even need kind of whisper this in the shadows what's your experience now with people knowing and understanding and accepting this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah most of the folks that i work with come to me because they know and understand and accept this but it's it's and some folks can work through the process very quickly and istdp we call those low resistance patients they come in ready to go all these defenses have been lowered they understand what they need to do they trust me they trust the process and you can just see this transformation pretty quickly these are some of the more remarkable recovery stories you might see or very quickly we're able to like work through the little bit of defenses point them out they notice them we work together to kind of you know work through them and then these emotions can kind of come up other people it's more complicated and it's harder i was one of the people that's more complicated i still am to this day very guarded and defended i still am in therapy and i have a lot of challenges getting in a lot of the core issues and emotions but i'll tell you a little bit more about what the process looks like i guess what gets in the way so we might start talking about something it's not a big deal\n\nSPEAKER_01: in istdp we're always checking what do you notice in your body as you talk about this person\n\nSPEAKER_01: often our anger comes in and when we check into the body body doesn't lie brain will lie they'll say i'm angry i'm so mad\n\nSPEAKER_01: but we check in the body and often in the beginning you'll see tension\n\nSPEAKER_01: right what do you notice my stomach's tight i feel constriction\n\nSPEAKER_01: my shoulders you know those are the different places and that's anxiety they don't know they're anxious subconscious what they're anxious about are these feelings that ward off tense rage anger and actually underneath all of that guilt and so once they get to notice that they realize they're not really angry at all they know they should be but their bodies are really afraid about this feeling and so and usually the pain will start like in groups it's it's really quite funny to watch when i run through someone get activated you'll see the other people oh my god this chair you know to stand up adjust or you know they just get activated by other people's emotion and so we teach them that you know they might have to get up and go to the bathroom people with ip style coffee i gotta go to the bathroom that's a way to ward off the feelings another way is what we call cognitive disruption they lose their train of thought happens all the time or just talking about what did you ask i can't remember what you said that's that's a defense and so we'll point these out intellectualization well i need to just forgive them she had a hard life we get there istp gets tremendous forgiveness but you can't short circuit it with defensive behavior so once they are able to work through those real the somatic experience of anger and rage is often allowed to come through that's very different it's a looseness it's it's a warmth it wants to move and push up and out of the person we'll see them sign\n\nSPEAKER_01: that's an activation we'll notice hands moving clenching sometimes grabbing we watch the leg movement when you see activation and they talk about a warm loose feeling that's a somatic experience of grabbing\n\nSPEAKER_01: and sometimes we'll ask them they'll have visions you know quick images i have this picture person sometimes it's not even a person start to talk about it quickly go to primary caregivers people who use them it's called unlocking it comes out in its fullest form it is the most dramatic part of the healing process it doesn't happen in all cases but when it does it usually leads to some pretty dramatic improvements\n\nSPEAKER_00: what sorts of conditions or symptoms are people coming in to address with this\n\nSPEAKER_01: back pain knee pain shoulder pain headaches fibromyalgia so i didn't get into this you know i got in it more for the those kinds of issues my first two clients i saw both had fibromyalgia i didn't know much about it at the time this is going back about ten years but i had read some of schumer and lumbley's work that they had effectively so i started using it with them with an understanding to say hey you're the first people i've seen with this i can't really promise you know what will happen i just know that other people and they both got better very very quickly in fact went back to their doctors and told them they were cured the doctor called me to say what what happened\n\nSPEAKER_01: this happened and as you can imagine after that my practice really picked up quickly so i have been working more with folks with fibromyalgia i take them readily because i do believe that it's the only thing that i've learned that really can cure it at least you know keep in mind the people i see have been through everything else i'm never the first stop usually the last so you know they'll come with all these other things that they've done and tried a lot of frustration about it i started to work with people with long covid and me those were not on my initial list but\n\nSPEAKER_01: with long covid i was very hesitant because i didn't know what it was or what was going on last thing i wanted to say that this could be helpful there was no evidence out there and i had never seen anyone but there is starting to be some research showing that emotion focused therapy and helpful so i have started to see people with long covid and me and have been having some success with that as well\n\nSPEAKER_00: are you seeing a shift in the professional community in terms of accepting this sort of therapy and treatment\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah that's been the most amazing thing as someone who you know went through his own process over twenty years ago and kind of as i said hid in the shadows with this it's it's really been incredible to watch the change in fact right after this i'm going to switch to another zoom meeting and i'm training doctors here in our local hospital on this as part of a community of us that's been doing this work so yes i get calls from doctors a lot now not just for you know training or teach me about this but can you see my patients because you know there's a growing recognition even in medical school now they're starting to get some there was no pain curriculum medical school and they're starting to have one now and starting to look to scientifically supported approaches back pain is not scientifically supported or back surgery the evidence shows that most people with back pain only twenty to thirty percent of them get better and most of them have long term problems after one of the biggest diagnoses now is failed back surgery syndrome just doesn't work in most cases and our approaches have much higher success rates that research is really supportive\n\nSPEAKER_00: so what do you think about the people out there that are maybe a bit resistant to this idea or reluctant to go into therapy because it's going to be a really painful thing to endure but yet they're still struggling with their health what do you think what do you think's happening there\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah that's that's a good question dealing with emotions is never easy it is some of the hardest work that we'll ever do istdp is incredibly difficult approach it's incredibly supportive of people but it's different and i do liken it to you know some different therapies that people go to that they found helpful but don't cure them which i used to do cognitive behavioral therapy person centered therapy those were my approaches prior to\n\nSPEAKER_01: they were helpful but i liken them more to like a walk like walking is really good for it's great for your health right everybody should go for a walk and walk a lot and it's easy and it doesn't cause istdp is more like crossfit right if you really want to change your body going for a twenty minute walk every day is not going to do it you got to get in the gym and put the more severe work and that's what i like\n\nSPEAKER_01: a really supportive crossfit coach because the goal for us we have this threshold that we're working at right this emotional capacity that people have for these difficulties and most people with chronic pain or emotional thresholds very low and so what we want to do is increase the threshold gradually and our therapy should get people to the emotion that they can tolerate deal with without going over because it will have setbacks without staying too low because then we won't see progress just like good fitness right just take off and run a marathon after just walking ten minutes you would build up to it to your maximum capacity so that's the goal with istp so we do look to take people you know a little bit further every time without going too far that's difficult\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i suspect one of the biggest barriers for people is even before this because most of us think of our you know mental health and our physical health and those are two separate things and if you're going through major physical health problems addressing your mental health stuff is a nice to have when i was really sick i started going into therapy and counseling but it wasn't to make myself get better that wasn't my motivation it was just to help me cope with the sickness and keep me going until i found my physical cure so it's it's such a change in mindset and our understanding of what's happening to even get people to the place where they see this as a part of their path to getting better\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah my clients will say that all the time people\n\nSPEAKER_01: say this looks different why didn't i find this my answer is always the same you find this when the time's right and not everyone's ready for this at this point in their lives and you know probably about seventy to eighty percent of my people get better but twenty to thirty percent it's not the right time for them and we'll decide together that it's not and one of the things i published a study on a group that i ran we were actually looking at data and one of the things we do notice is that people get better generally have a setback at some point as things start to get more difficult emotionally these defenses get really activated and their symptoms will flare up or new things will happen and that's the time that's the make or break time people who really believe in it and know that a setback is part of the progress we'll stick with it and work through it and get better and people that aren't so sure about this will say well this is just bringing up all kinds of stuff you know i'm already sick you know now i got to deal with all these emotions too and they might be the ones that decide this isn't the right time for them people get better in my study were the ones that believed in it so much at the start that they worked through the setbacks and were able to make a lot of progress after that\n\nSPEAKER_00: well doug this is just incredible i just my head explodes every time i have a conversation with someone like yourself it's so amazing to have professionals out there who are aware of this and out there and available and helping people because\n\nSPEAKER_00: it's not the case just a very short time ago so i really appreciate you taking the time today to walk us through this and to show us you know the science behind it this is real this is helpful and it is that message that it is coming into mainstream conventional practices is really encouraging to hear as well so yeah thank you so much for this\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're welcome thank you for talking to me i appreciate it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i'm curious from the viewers what questions you have love to see it and what's your experience been with all of this what's your take and also want to send a shout out to channel member yousef david thank you so much you said for the support and joining the channel sending big hugs to you i really appreciate it and for people watching i know this is a lot to take in if you're not already on my mailing list i do send out a weekly newsletter that summarizes and bullet points kind of the key takeaways from the interviews if

This is the initial coding stage, where insights will be drawn directly from the text. The results from this stage will determine the subsequent theme generation process.\n\nIn this stage, you will generate codes. Codes are the foundational units of inductive thematic analysis, capturing significant concepts and ideas from the transcripts. Each code includes a concise name, a meaningful description, and representative quotes from the transcripts.\n\nIn this task, a 'code' should be related to the desires, needs, and meaningful outcomes for participants. Codes pertain to participants. Codes describe the feeling of the participant themselves.\n\nYour goal is to carefully look through the text and identify all codes discussed by the participant exhaustively. Each code should be specific and distinct without overlaps.\n\nIdentify all relevant codes in the text, provide a Name for each code in 8 to 15 words in sentence case.\n\nWrite with concise, concrete details and avoid clichés, generalizations.\n\nGive a dense Description of the code in 50 words and direct quotes from the participant for each code. \n\nIf _absolutely_ necessary quotes can consist of multiple excerpts from the text. Use ellipses to shorten quotes if needed, but avoid this if possible.

excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n</input_text>\nAlways

excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for

sore throat headaches enlarged lymph nodes muscle pain joint pain unrefreshing sleep debilitating fatigue nausea food intolerances post exertional malaise dizziness digestive issues allergies sensitivities to light sound smells and chemicals irregular heartbeat shortness of breath just to name a few and with mecfs whether these symptoms come on suddenly or slowly creep up over time this onslaught of new symptoms can be overwhelming and confusing and scary and we live in a world that has pretty much taught us to treat our unwell body like a broken down car so your car is not running like it should you might need a new battery or alternator or a new fan or belt of some sort we're told that our body like our car has a bunch of separate parts and when we are unwell we are to focus on each part in our body separately and fix each part individually so when we find ourselves facing this nightmarish illness known as mecfs we naturally might set off and try and tackle these symptoms that we are seeing in our bodies and fix them each one by one so of course we're overwhelmed and confused where does one even start so in an attempt to tackle this topic i've invited my good friends liz carlson and pamela rose who like me have lived with and fully recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome or mecfs to join me in a conversation about the potential role and value of focus on symptoms and comparing our symptoms with others i think most of us during our lives are brought up and conditioned and taught to focus on symptoms probably one because we don't have that many because we're generally healthy hopefully and two just because this is kind of how society seems to be wired so you have a symptom you focus on it you google the heck out of it you get yourself all worried about it you talk to other people you see if anyone else is facing something similar you go to the doctor you see how to fix that symptom and what you need to do to treat it in my experience with mecfs this never really got me anywhere because this illness can express itself in so many different ways and for me recovery ended up being not about focusing on symptoms and treating specific symptoms but on supporting my body as a whole i definitely did do some symptom management along the way and it was more of a means to an end or a way to keep myself comfortable during the process of recovery but targeting the specific symptoms was never healing them in my experience so if i had pain i might take painkillers or if i was having really bad problems with sleeping and i was trying everything under the sun and nothing would work i might go see my doctor and get some prescription sedatives so the symptom management that i did was more palliative and not so much about recovery now i'm certainly not advocating that symptoms in our bodies should be ignored i think we do need to pay attention to them of course go to our doctors get the tests done necessary to see what's going on if it's anything that we should be concerned about or if this is just part of our lovely mecfs package but i've definitely found that once we have assessed that these symptoms aren't a sign of something else that it's just part of mecfs that putting too much concentration on them isn't really helpful\n\nSPEAKER_01: honest moment so after sharing my full recovery story from mecfs i get a lot of great supportive messages but i also get asked to compare my own symptoms triggers and challenges with others sometimes the exact levels and if i have fixes right now\n\nSPEAKER_01: i'm here to tell you why symptom comparison and stop the symptom thinking isn't actually helpful to healing and i totally understand i was once in your shoes so i think i can bring an interesting perspective to this because i help people manage conditions like mecfs every day and yes something that people are always keen to talk about is my story when they hear that i've been there and i fully recovered from me cfs they really want to know what helped me and of course they do and i remember what it's like i remember how desperate i was to find the thing that was going to fix me i spent thousands of hours googling my symptoms to find other people with those symptoms and what pathogens they could be or what organ can be affected so i can then take herbs or find supplements to fix those symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_01: this led me to spend thousands of dollars this led me to buy tree bark shipped directly from africa this led me to almost poisoning myself by buying organic elderberries from oregon and eating them not realizing you're supposed to sip them in a tea this led me to many doctor's appointments trying to figure out what was broken with me it led me to many forms trying to compare my viral levels with other people's viral levels and then seeing what prescription antivirals they took and if they said i took them but they didn't really help me much i'd be like well they helped you some i need to get those but you know what i crash anyway well the supplements did help me get by paralegal enough to walk two blocks to my grocery store and back i needed a more comprehensive strategy to actually heal that didn't involve just trying to stop all my symptoms one by one\n\nSPEAKER_00: now that i've recovered and i'm sharing my story i get quite a few people reaching out to me and telling me a bit of their stories and about what their experience has been which is really incredible i love connecting with so many people in this way i think it's a really amazing thing one common theme that i see is that quite a few people want to compare their symptoms against mine they want to see i have this did you have this happening or i have that or can you tell me what symptoms you had for this and i think this happens for a couple of very understandable reasons i think the first reason that this is happening that i suspect is that people want to see if we're the same if my symptoms match your symptoms and i recovered then that means that there's good hope that you can recover but if my symptoms are different you might assess that that means oh that that means that you can't recover\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i just was seeking reassurance you know my symptoms worse than other people's are they bad good what helped one person is that going to help me and what i absolutely know now from helping schools of people is that what can be hugely helpful for one person can make lots of just a difference for somebody else unfortunately\n\nSPEAKER_00: and the second reason i suspect this is happening is because people want to treat their specific symptoms so if i had a specific symptom that they had they want to know what i did to get rid of it\n\nSPEAKER_01: another reason people reach out to people who've recovered trying to compare symptoms is because they want them to tell them what to do and that's not honestly how i healed i had to look in the mirror and say liz i'm going to save you and you know i did have coaches who are so helpful to me at the end of the day i had to call the shots and trust my own intuition\n\nSPEAKER_00: so both of these things are very understandable but i think both of them can also be problematic and i think this can be problematic because this illness can express itself in so many different ways if someone is sizing up their illness against my illness and it doesn't match exactly and then from that what they take away is that they do not have a chance of recovering obviously that's a really dangerous mindset to get into many different illnesses can express themselves in many different ways and it does not mean that it's not the same thing and the second way that it's if not problematic just not helpful is because if people want to know about my specific symptoms and how i treated them i didn't actually treat them specifically so i just really have nothing to offer people who want to know how i handle different symptoms and i suspect that the response that i give them is not very satisfying usually along the lines of yeah i generally pulled myself out of this illness by treating my body in a holistic manner and as i slowly improved overall my symptoms slowly decreased until they were eventually gone which in the moment if you've got one really annoying or frustrating or difficult symptom that you're trying to get rid of is probably frustrating to hear\n\nSPEAKER_01: another reason you might want to compare your symptoms with someone else who is healed is because you're worried that your symptoms are so numerous so scary so crazy and you want reassurance that it's still possible for you too to heal and i just want to say yes it is possible for you to heal no matter how random crazy or numerous your symptoms no matter the levels and while i list many symptoms on my website and in my interview with raylan i shared some as well there's tons of i don't mention but it's because listing every single symptom isn't going to help you get out at the end of the day the symptoms aren't the issue the symptoms are just your body's manifestation of disease i would encourage people to yes do some reading online maybe research some things purely from a point of view of it being reassuring and inspiring but don't get too caught up on comparing symptoms scanning information for what were their test results what were the particular blood levels they had for certain things what really helped them it probably won't help you personally just use that to inspire you to perhaps give you some ideas but don't get too carried away don't compare\n\nSPEAKER_01: your symptoms with somebody else's your test results with somebody else's test results stay true to what's going to work for you certainly when it comes to test results knowing what somebody's blood reports were doesn't really impact or have any correlation to what yours were because it depends what your starting point was what's normal for you you know i promised that if i ever got out of the health hole that is mecfs i would share my story to help inspire others but what i didn't sign up for was to troubleshoot people's symptoms one on one\n\nSPEAKER_01: i actually know quite a few people who recovered who share their story and then got overwhelmed by all the messages and then they left social media because it was just too much and i myself am an empathetic person but i'm also a person who now has boundaries and one of my boundaries is not talking about my old symptoms with other people and also not talking about their symptoms with them either\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i love hearing positive messages and getting feedback of what people might want to hear but i choose not to talk about symptoms one on one even writing my own story on my blog honestly took me forever because it's pretty traumatizing going back there i mean i look at it now and just words on a page but\n\nSPEAKER_01: this was the worst thing that ever happened to me and\n\nSPEAKER_01: if you're there you know that so consider that the people who share their stories are still human and it might still be fresh their challenges on their journey another thing i just want to touch on is the fact that i'm really not a fan of labels i get people coming to me especially at the moment with people who have got long covid as we call it in the uk post covid fatigue and they want to know have i still got post viral fatigue or is this mecfs you know i'm not a huge fan of labels because to be honest it doesn't change doesn't change anything what it's called doesn't suddenly change how you're feeling or how long you've had it or how long it's going to take you to recover the important thing is you are doing something about it so although there are a couple of instances where perhaps it's useful to have a label like if you really are in the deep sort of chronic end of the extreme fatigue scale and you need to get signed off work and those sorts of things from a practicality point of view can be useful but on the whole labels don't make a difference and comparing your symptoms to somebody else's and are yours worse or better than theirs again that's something that i really encourage people not to get too caught up in i'm a big believer that if the severity of the symptoms that you are experiencing is enough to change your life to a certain extent then that's severe for you it doesn't matter how it compares to somebody else's life it's all about your journey through and i guess that's the point i keep coming back to today is make this personal to you build your recovery plan for you and i hope that this has been helpful i want you to look at your own life like a scientist without freaking out about everything yeah i hope that made sense to you and sending you my support along your healing journey you've got this so my key message to everybody watching this is look at your own personal journey through this don't compare your results to somebody else's because your starting points would be different your whole makeup will be different there are so many different factors that can\n\nSPEAKER_01: play a part in that and the one thing that i think all three of us absolutely agree on is that everybody's experience of living with mecfs is different not only because how long you've been on that journey might differ the severity of your symptoms what your symptoms are indeed but because of our individual lifestyles so just like pacing has to be tailored individually for a particular person because their life is so different i truly believe somebody's recovery plan and them selecting the things they want to try\n\nSPEAKER_01: needs to be tailored as well\n\nSPEAKER_00: so what do you guys think do you find it helpful to pay a lot of attention to your specific symptoms or are you also having the experience of recovery being a more holistic process are there times when you find it helpful to compare with other people you've heard our thoughts it's just three of us we'd love to hear yours as always this is how we learn this is how we grow this is how we get past this so let's keep the conversation going in the comments because we'd love to hear your feedback and your experience with all of this and a huge thank you to liz and pamela for taking part in this i very much appreciate having your contributions to this and i'm sure everyone else does as well and if you enjoyed this video you might like this video right here on the screen where i review some of the latest research coming out of harvard that helps us better understand mecfs so take care everyone sending love to you all i hope you're doing well thank you for watching and i'll see you again soon\n</input_text>\nAlways use the

sore throat headaches enlarged lymph nodes muscle pain joint pain unrefreshing sleep debilitating fatigue nausea food intolerances post exertional malaise dizziness digestive issues allergies sensitivities to light sound smells and chemicals irregular heartbeat shortness of breath just to name a few and with mecfs whether these symptoms come on suddenly or slowly creep up over time this onslaught of new symptoms can be overwhelming and confusing and scary and we live in a world that has pretty much taught us to treat our unwell body like a broken down car so your car is not running like it should you might need a new battery or alternator or a new fan or belt of some sort we're told that our body like our car has a bunch of separate parts and when we are unwell we are to focus on each part in our body separately and fix each part individually so when we find ourselves facing this nightmarish illness known as mecfs we naturally might set off and try and tackle these symptoms that we are seeing in our bodies and fix them each one by one so of course we're overwhelmed and confused where does one even start so in an attempt to tackle this topic i've invited my good friends liz carlson and pamela rose who like me have lived with and fully recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome or mecfs to join me in a conversation about the potential role and value of focus on symptoms and comparing our symptoms with others i think most of us during our lives are brought up and conditioned and taught to focus on symptoms probably one because we don't have that many because we're generally healthy hopefully and two just because this is kind of how society seems to be wired so you have a symptom you focus on it you google the heck out of it you get yourself all worried about it you talk to other people you see if anyone else is facing something similar you go to the doctor you see how to fix that symptom and what you need to do to treat it in my experience with mecfs this never really got me anywhere because this illness can express itself in so many different ways and for me recovery ended up being not about focusing on symptoms and treating specific symptoms but on supporting my body as a whole i definitely did do some symptom management along the way and it was more of a means to an end or a way to keep myself comfortable during the process of recovery but targeting the specific symptoms was never healing them in my experience so if i had pain i might take painkillers or if i was having really bad problems with sleeping and i was trying everything under the sun and nothing would work i might go see my doctor and get some prescription sedatives so the symptom management that i did was more palliative and not so much about recovery now i'm certainly not advocating that symptoms in our bodies should be ignored i think we do need to pay attention to them of course go to our doctors get the tests done necessary to see what's going on if it's anything that we should be concerned about or if this is just part of our lovely mecfs package but i've definitely found that once we have assessed that these symptoms aren't a sign of something else that it's just part of mecfs that putting too much concentration on them isn't really helpful\n\nSPEAKER_01: honest moment so after sharing my full recovery story from mecfs i get a lot of great supportive messages but i also get asked to compare my own symptoms triggers and challenges with others sometimes the exact levels and if i have fixes right now\n\nSPEAKER_01: i'm here to tell you why symptom comparison and stop the symptom thinking isn't actually helpful to healing and i totally understand i was once in your shoes so i think i can bring an interesting perspective to this because i help people manage conditions like mecfs every day and yes something that people are always keen to talk about is my story when they hear that i've been there and i fully recovered from me cfs they really want to know what helped me and of course they do and i remember what it's like i remember how desperate i was to find the thing that was going to fix me i spent thousands of hours googling my symptoms to find other people with those symptoms and what pathogens they could be or what organ can be affected so i can then take herbs or find supplements to fix those symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_01: this led me to spend thousands of dollars this led me to buy tree bark shipped directly from africa this led me to almost poisoning myself by buying organic elderberries from oregon and eating them not realizing you're supposed to sip them in a tea this led me to many doctor's appointments trying to figure out what was broken with me it led me to many forms trying to compare my viral levels with other people's viral levels and then seeing what prescription antivirals they took and if they said i took them but they didn't really help me much i'd be like well they helped you some i need to get those but you know what i crash anyway well the supplements did help me get by paralegal enough to walk two blocks to my grocery store and back i needed a more comprehensive strategy to actually heal that didn't involve just trying to stop all my symptoms one by one\n\nSPEAKER_00: now that i've recovered and i'm sharing my story i get quite a few people reaching out to me and telling me a bit of their stories and about what their experience has been which is really incredible i love connecting with so many people in this way i think it's a really amazing thing one common theme that i see is that quite a few people want to compare their symptoms against mine they want to see i have this did you have this happening or i have that or can you tell me what symptoms you had for this and i think this happens for a couple of very understandable reasons i think the first reason that this is happening that i suspect is that people want to see if we're the same if my symptoms match your symptoms and i recovered then that means that there's good hope that you can recover but if my symptoms are different you might assess that that means oh that that means that you can't recover\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i just was seeking reassurance you know my symptoms worse than other people's are they bad good what helped one person is that going to help me and what i absolutely know now from helping schools of people is that what can be hugely helpful for one person can make lots of just a difference for somebody else unfortunately\n\nSPEAKER_00: and the second reason i suspect this is happening is because people want to treat their specific symptoms so if i had a specific symptom that they had they want to know what i did to get rid of it\n\nSPEAKER_01: another reason people reach out to people who've recovered trying to compare symptoms is because they want them to tell them what to do and that's not honestly how i healed i had to look in the mirror and say liz i'm going to save you and you know i did have coaches who are so helpful to me at the end of the day i had to call the shots and trust my own intuition\n\nSPEAKER_00: so both of these things are very understandable but i think both of them can also be problematic and i think this can be problematic because this illness can express itself in so many different ways if someone is sizing up their illness against my illness and it doesn't match exactly and then from that what they take away is that they do not have a chance of recovering obviously that's a really dangerous mindset to get into many different illnesses can express themselves in many different ways and it does not mean that it's not the same thing and the second way that it's if not problematic just not helpful is because if people want to know about my specific symptoms and how i treated them i didn't actually treat them specifically so i just really have nothing to offer people who want to know how i handle different symptoms and i suspect that the response that i give them is not very satisfying usually along the lines of yeah i generally pulled myself out of this illness by treating my body in a holistic manner and as i slowly improved overall my symptoms slowly decreased until they were eventually gone which in the moment if you've got one really annoying or frustrating or difficult symptom that you're trying to get rid of is probably frustrating to hear\n\nSPEAKER_01: another reason you might want to compare your symptoms with someone else who is healed is because you're worried that your symptoms are so numerous so scary so crazy and you want reassurance that it's still possible for you too to heal and i just want to say yes it is possible for you to heal no matter how random crazy or numerous your symptoms no matter the levels and while i list many symptoms on my website and in my interview with raylan i shared some as well there's tons of i don't mention but it's because listing every single symptom isn't going to help you get out at the end of the day the symptoms aren't the issue the symptoms are just your body's manifestation of disease i would encourage people to yes do some reading online maybe research some things purely from a point of view of it being reassuring and inspiring but don't get too caught up on comparing symptoms scanning information for what were their test results what were the particular blood levels they had for certain things what really helped them it probably won't help you personally just use that to inspire you to perhaps give you some ideas but don't get too carried away don't compare\n\nSPEAKER_01: your symptoms with somebody else's your test results with somebody else's test results stay true to what's going to work for you certainly when it comes to test results knowing what somebody's blood reports were doesn't really impact or have any correlation to what yours were because it depends what your starting point was what's normal for you you know i promised that if i ever got out of the health hole that is mecfs i would share my story to help inspire others but what i didn't sign up for was to troubleshoot people's symptoms one on one\n\nSPEAKER_01: i actually know quite a few people who recovered who share their story and then got overwhelmed by all the messages and then they left social media because it was just too much and i myself am an empathetic person but i'm also a person who now has boundaries and one of my boundaries is not talking about my old symptoms with other people and also not talking about their symptoms with them either\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i love hearing positive messages and getting feedback of what people might want to hear but i choose not to talk about symptoms one on one even writing my own story on my blog honestly took me forever because it's pretty traumatizing going back there i mean i look at it now and just words on a page but\n\nSPEAKER_01: this was the worst thing that ever happened to me and\n\nSPEAKER_01: if you're there you know that so consider that the people who share their stories are still human and it might still be fresh their challenges on their journey another thing i just want to touch on is the fact that i'm really not a fan of labels i get people coming to me especially at the moment with people who have got long covid as we call it in the uk post covid fatigue and they want to know have i still got post viral fatigue or is this mecfs you know i'm not a huge fan of labels because to be honest it doesn't change doesn't change anything what it's called doesn't suddenly change how you're feeling or how long you've had it or how long it's going to take you to recover the important thing is you are doing something about it so although there are a couple of instances where perhaps it's useful to have a label like if you really are in the deep sort of chronic end of the extreme fatigue scale and you need to get signed off work and those sorts of things from a practicality point of view can be useful but on the whole labels don't make a difference and comparing your symptoms to somebody else's and are yours worse or better than theirs again that's something that i really encourage people not to get too caught up in i'm a big believer that if the severity of the symptoms that you are experiencing is enough to change your life to a certain extent then that's severe for you it doesn't matter how it compares to somebody else's life it's all about your journey through and i guess that's the point i keep coming back to today is make this personal to you build your recovery plan for you and i hope that this has been helpful i want you to look at your own life like a scientist without freaking out about everything yeah i hope that made sense to you and sending you my support along your healing journey you've got this so my key message to everybody watching this is look at your own personal journey through this don't compare your results to somebody else's because your starting points would be different your whole makeup will be different there are so many different factors that can\n\nSPEAKER_01: play a part in that and the one thing that i think all three of us absolutely agree on is that everybody's experience of living with mecfs is different not only because how long you've been on that journey might differ the severity of your symptoms what your symptoms are indeed but because of our individual lifestyles so just like pacing has to be tailored individually for a particular person because their life is so different i truly believe somebody's recovery plan and them selecting the things they want to try\n\nSPEAKER_01: needs to be tailored as well\n\nSPEAKER_00: so what do you guys think do you find it helpful to pay a lot of attention to your specific symptoms or are you also having the experience of recovery being a more holistic process are there times when you find it helpful to compare with other people you've heard our thoughts it's just three of us we'd love to hear yours as always this is how we learn this is how we grow this is how we get past this so let's keep the conversation going in the comments because we'd love to hear your feedback and your experience with all of this and a huge thank you to liz and pamela for taking part in this i very much appreciate having your contributions to this and i'm sure everyone else does as well and if you enjoyed this video you might like this video right here on the screen where i review some of the latest research coming out of harvard that helps us better understand mecfs so take care everyone sending love to you all i hope you're doing well thank you for watching and i'll see you again

here today because she is going to be sharing some of her journey with chronic illness which includes diagnosis for chronic fatigue syndrome as well as some other things i'll let her go into details of that but i'm just really excited to have you here welcome katie thank you for having me i'm so excited to meet with you and to be here i am really excited to hear more about your story and i'm so grateful and beyond impressed that you are willing and able to do this right now because i hope you don't mind my sharing but katie is thirty eight weeks pregnant as we speak\n\nSPEAKER_00: hopefully not during this interview but that would add some excitement\n\nSPEAKER_00: well you're a trooper thanks for doing us i hope your week goes well you induced on your wednesday getting induced on wednesday so very exciting your world is about to get even crazier\n\nSPEAKER_00: i'm excited that's the thing like life opened up and once we got better you know everyone must be feeling this like i got a second chance at life\n\nSPEAKER_00: everything i just like i don't even know because i couldn't even picture my future before i think it was too hard to dream or hope and now it's like who knows what will happen it's just amazing if i'm having even the slightest bad day i catch these moments and i have to catch myself and be like you are a walking miracle like this is incredible you are living something that you dreamed about every day for years like your life is a dream whatever it is that's stressing you out does not matter it does not matter yeah absolutely and it's it's funny that's one of my prayers is may i never forget may i never forget and become\n\nSPEAKER_00: no offense but like a normal person\n\nSPEAKER_00: who takes it for granted i never forget because that joy is so enlivening and it's like every day it's like you're winning the race every day you're like yes\n\nSPEAKER_00: it's like being like when you watch a six year old wandering through the world and they're just like a flower a tree a puppy\n\nSPEAKER_00: these new eyes where you just get to almost be childlike again and just really appreciate things so much so yeah i hope it doesn't go away yeah i don't think i don't think it will but it's something i do think about often\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think i'll appreciate this it is hard though to have friends who've never been through it like most of my friends have obviously never been through it and they complain about their lives and i just feel such a detachment sometimes it is hard\n\nSPEAKER_00: as much as it probably was hard for them to be my friend through it sometimes it's hard for me to be their friend now because i'm like you have it all\n\nSPEAKER_00: i really struggle with people who probably we all have our triggers but people who seem physically able to go to the gym but just choose not to\n\nSPEAKER_00: it was the worst for me when i was sick like i would give anything to because i love working out so that's one of my things that i really miss so when i can see people who could and just did it of course i don't know their life and i don't know what they're facing and they've got their own reasons and limitations i have no clue what's going on in their world but yes i know i know exactly what you mean i felt that way about people who complain about work and i'm like that's all i want to be able to do like i was my life and my identity but yeah you're right you know people are entitled to complain about their lives yeah their problems are real\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does change things so it is nice to just connect with other people who kind of had this experience just before we dive in as i always say i'm not a medical professional katie is an occupational therapist so she is a medical professional but neither one of us are for sure your medical professionals at the moment so we're just sharing our own personal experience of living with and recovering from chronic illness so certainly nothing of what we share should be considered medical advice my story actually begins in childhood actually because i did have some major infection that impacted my ability to go to school and i was in the hospital no one knew really was wrong and the reason bring that up it's because it's relevant to later it was constant fungal infections in my stomach intestines and the doctor find it a lot of times couldn't treat it it's believed that some of that stuff may have triggered my genetic condition i did recover from that so i knew healing was possible and it wasn't until twenty fourteen that i actually started experience chronic fatigue symptoms where i couldn't walk i just wasn't recovering sleep so i would be working for about every i don't know two to four months and then i would end up collapsing and i just couldn't recover fully so anytime i did a strenuous task i would have that sort of\n\nSPEAKER_00: price to pay so to speak so that's when i knew something was more serious and started to investigate it and try to heal so what happened when you initially went to the doctors what did they say i was initially diagnosed with fibromyalgia they completely ignored the ability that i was having a hard time moving against gravity and fatigued they really missed the fatigue so it took a while before i even got the chronic fatigue diagnosis but no one would even really treat it i don't think they really what to do they looked at just blood work ology it just really i wasn't really getting care for it for many years yeah unfortunately such a common story i'm sure you've seen as well it seems to be the same for so many of us in the beginning not a lot of answers not a lot of help so what did you do well i kept rehabilitate myself being an occupational therapist and leaving that possible because childhood experience i just\n\nSPEAKER_00: researching doctors researching as much as i could and then eventually i moved from new york city back home to buffalo and that's where i got linked with some really great doctors first an integrated nurse practitioner\n\nSPEAKER_00: level of investigative blood work that i was not used to i call her the blood detective she was looking at underlying infections candida epstein barr virus real infections and she went out helped me to go after that and for a while that actually made me worse it was pretty brutal treatment she would try to build my body up but at the same time it was getting down these infections i could for some reason never my body just couldn't fight and that was the missing link why couldn't my body fight these infections other people have epstein barr virus and they recover what was it about my body that was the missing link that's what brought me to my other doctor who's an immunologist and probably the most brilliant man i know and he started looking at genetic conditions that have to do with metabolic myopathies and mitochondrial dysfunction and what direction did he suggest going for that or what where did you take it from there so i had full genetic or full genome testing done and i did find that i have mitochondrial disease called mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome eleven and when i read about it it was like tears down my face because it's like targets the diaphragm i was like this is it finally and he put me on the cocktail which helped basically my body wasn't producing mitochondria i could never fight infections my body strength to fight so by him supplementing and boosting my mitochondria i could now fight the infections that i was trying for probably like a year and a half prior and when you came together it was like\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow before you got this what were your days like or what were your weeks like oh my goodness i was working on a master's degree which you know is a lot it's a lot of work there full days i was doing clinical rotations i had friends i went out almost every night of the week i don't even know how i didn't look good in school i love to socialize i love to go out i traveled i lived in colorado i lived in philadelphia new york city i'm sure everyone was shocked when i got just not something that anyone probably could have predicted or coming wasn't at all like my childhood experience it's completely different yeah it sounds like it came on pretty suddenly it seems like that but when i look back i think that there were some signs that i was stressed i had been in graduate school i'd been in a stressful relationship a toxic relationship i was just probably overworking myself i was living in new york city working very long hours i was a traveling therapist at one point so i was walking i was working ten hour days walking from one end of manhattan to the other end of manhattan i'm warning signs i wasn't necessarily the healthiest person\n\nSPEAKER_00: so many things it just really seems like so many of us have so much of the same you know it seems like it comes on suddenly but when we look back we see we have pretty much i mean i'm sure it's not everybody but i imagine you've noticed the same really pushing it not taking such good care of ourselves but on the surface we look so vibrant so healthy we're always on the go we might be working out a lot you know just very social happy looking people so you went from obviously being very active you know very engaged in life when you got sick what did that look like what did your days and your weeks look like after that for those for that first year however long before you started getting the help that you needed the first year was kind of basically me living in denial i would continue to try to work and people would pull me aside like this is dangerous\n\nSPEAKER_00: because i was also working with patients i was i was scared i rob people i was scared i hurt people i felt an ethical responsibility it just wasn't safe i didn't feel safe riding the subway home because i thought i'd fall asleep or pass out and wake up and not know but it was very difficult to do grocery shopping so i just kept trying and then\n\nSPEAKER_00: it took me a while to realize that this was serious and that it needed a full time job so eventually you had to quit your job and focus on getting your health back what are some other things that have contributed to your recovery i would say lifestyle modification i had to dramatically change my diet through i had to do basically an elimination diet first to figure out what was causing basically use food as medicine as a mindset of healing and then i also had to really work on rehab through movement and for me that's really important because i can't get my cells oxygen if i'm not so i know movement is a very hot topic and it is very controversial because it's not done properly but i had to\n\nSPEAKER_00: gradually increase my ability to\n\nSPEAKER_00: and then also i removed all toxic ingredients immunotoxic i\n\nSPEAKER_00: water filtration system on my house i just the lengths which i went to and it really helped my so you mentioned diet played a big role and it seems that a lot of us find this and i'm curious what diet changes ended up helping for you not because i think necessarily it's the key for anyone else but i think it's good for people to see that there are different paths to health through diet for people and it is very much individual so i'm curious for you what ended up being your what did your body respond to well the three main offenders that were pretty obvious before i even did the elimination diet were dairy gluten and sugar and then from there i tried many different diets i did find for me i needed a high protein meat based diet i don't know if that's\n\nSPEAKER_00: mitochondrial disease but when i tried vegetarian i had a hard time with beans i had a hard time with soy and so i struggled with some of those components of it so i found that some nightshades bother me i don't know if i'm familiar with nightshades but i did have a problem with those for a while nightshades that's things like what is that is that tomatoes and bell peppers or what is yes it's tomato potatoes eggplant the one i can't take i can't tolerate anymore i can't see the funny thing when i did the elimination diet and i gave my body a break to heal i slowly could incorporate those things back in without being as inflamed over time so it's kind of scary at first you're like what am i going to have left but eggs were bothering me for a while they don't bother me\n\nSPEAKER_00: just took some things out for a while gave my body that chance to heal and slowly would incorporate them and sometimes they did offend me still and sometimes they did well that's encouraging that you didn't have to cut everything out forever because that is a bit of a scary prognosis to look at for your life like how eating is just going to be stressful forever it was stressful and it's very hard to do i did it as a last resort after years of suffering it wasn't my first\n\nSPEAKER_00: trying to do that it is very hard\n\nSPEAKER_00: from my husband and my mom and help because i was honestly too sick to cook for myself and with those types of restrictions it's just hard to meal plan hard to it's a hard process and for me it also required i think i hear you saying the same thing but just a level of desperation because it is hard but you get to a point where you're so desperate you just need you'll do just about anything to get your health back so all of a sudden what felt unthinkable is suddenly doable and another thing that helped me because for a while i tried really hard to get my diet in order but i would cheat and fall off and then come back to it before i really got serious as time rolled on and i could see that i wasn't getting my life back i was going to have to get more serious but another thing sugar we all mentioned seem to mention sugar and sugar was a massive one for me and sugar was a tough one for me not just because i liked it and i didn't want to get rid of it because i clearly had a physical addiction it was intense i would get up in the middle of the night every single night and eat sugar like there was something happening i would sometimes take a spoon\n\nSPEAKER_01: and eat it right out of the\n\nSPEAKER_00: canister like it was insane so for me it was healing my gut getting more probiotics and i always thought it was a willpower thing i was just weak and i just why can't i stop i know this is bad for me but once my body started healing the cravings went away i think the desperation combined with the body starting to heal and get a bit more imbalance so those cravings go away and it all becomes a bit more doable it does become a bit more doable it's really hard at first and i had i have memories of being a little kid and like going in the corner and like eating treats like nonstop and bread i was obsessed with\n\nSPEAKER_00: eating that infection and there was some sort of addiction there and i mean it's very it's very hard to fight fight that but once i got broke through you're right i didn't feel those cravings the same way and doesn't it just feel like freedom i thought i was going to have to face this the rest of my life i thought my whole life was going to be a battle with food because it really was before i got sick and it's just incredible to have this healthy relationship with food where it's not a battle and you're not trying to force yourself to eat the right things okay so i just want to make sure i'm catching all of this so for you the main things\n\nSPEAKER_00: could you summarize for us what were the main things that worked for you for your recovery the main things that worked there's something\n\nSPEAKER_00: i did have to go back and heal trauma i had to do some spiritual healing so some mind body work i had to modify my diet i had to create some sort of movement routine that worked for my body that i could tolerate and not decline with and i had to remove all environmental toxins yeah it sounds very similar to my journey as well and i think it's good using the word movement and this was one of the mistakes i think when i talk about my recovery journey as i call it exercise and when people hear exercise they picture at the gym or going for a run but when i'm talking about my exercise program it was so small you know it was one to two minutes a day and in the beginning not even every single day and it was just really gentle movement because i think you're right it is definitely a sensitive topic and with good reason because full blown exercise can put people in the hospital even just three or four minutes of it and wrapping your head around i gotta get this lymph moving to reduce i have to put i have to and i have to get oxygen and nutrients to my cells and that happens through movement\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it's confusing because we're trying to get in sync with our body and listen to our body which is part of this journey but a big part of the message is our body is telling us some of the time it's just don't move but i found i couldn't rest my way out of this i couldn't just lay in bed or lay on the couch all day i was never going to get better i tried that for a long time and it didn't get me anywhere i agree i did the same thing so it's great there are so many things that did work for you were there some things that you tried that didn't work for you and what were they\n\nSPEAKER_00: that doesn't work chasing symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_00: i was in pain for a long time whether it was taking this pill taking this supplement everyone always wants to know what supplements i'm on and i'm going to real honest the supplements i take are based on my blood work and my genetic profile they're not necessarily applicable to else it doesn't\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i don't think supplements are the cure clearly the supplements i take are supporting metabolic disease i have where my body\n\nSPEAKER_00: so idea that there's going to be a quick\n\nSPEAKER_00: pill just chasing symptoms i mean you do need symptoms and it's one of the best things i ever did\n\nSPEAKER_00: one of the best things you did was go off coffee\n\nSPEAKER_00: hormonally helped rebalance my hormones healed my gut and also i have such good energy throughout the day it just it was it was shooting up my cortisol too much and rocking my just my adrenals so it made it made a big impact but for a while i was like quick fix like this\n\nSPEAKER_00: it seems like almost cruel advice for someone with chronic fatigue syndrome to say to stop having coffee what do you mean it's just the only thing that makes me feel better but it makes me feel better at least for me in the moment but it put me on such a roller coaster it messed up my blood sugar in time came to realize that big part of my afternoon crashes was just the caffeine crash and it's not a regular person caffeine crash with cfs it seems to be amplified it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah and it's a good point about the symptoms too i think we're all kind of brought up to chase symptoms you know we treat things one at a time we look at our body like a car you know fix little parts individually and i agree i think it's a balance you do have to treat some of them you know like for me i wasn't sleeping and i did all the things under the sun that you're supposed to do and it just wasn't working so for a while i had to take some you know prescription sedatives and like you had i had to target some symptoms individually but in the end what seems to pull its weight is looking at things in a more holistic viewpoint i agree and i had insomnia too and i had to take medication and i'm not against that but i'm talking about yeah overall healing yeah yeah when people ask things like you know what supplement should i take for brain fog or what should i do for you know whatever pain in my body and it's it's really hard i can't break any of it most of it down there wasn't specific things i did that worked for specific symptoms it was just slowly pulling my body out of all of it so i actually get some people messaging me or commenting on videos that are wanting to get pregnant or thinking about having a child and that actually naturally brings up a lot of stuff for them i don't have any children so i don't have anything to offer on this but i'm curious for you what has this process been like this pregnancy with your history of illness\n\nSPEAKER_00: well if you told me two years ago that i'd be pregnant i would have thought that that's crazy\n\nSPEAKER_00: like i was literally almost on my deathbed two years ago i could never have imagined this future i could have never imagined well enough because i didn't want to be a burden more of a burden to my husband i didn't want the financial responsibility i didn't think i could be a good mom i didn't want to\n\nSPEAKER_00: with that watch that so it was not even thought about and then when i got better so quickly heal and heal from endometriosis all these other things i was like well i kind of i have a good relationship with god right i was like well what's next what do you want from me and i did feel i gave my life over so i realized that was the one area i was holding back because i was still i didn't want to live in fear\n\nSPEAKER_00: because there's not a lot of research out there doctors couldn't make any promises to me\n\nSPEAKER_00: you'll be fine and i'm like\n\nSPEAKER_00: pregnant and so that set me on a course of learning how to give up control in a whole nother way and\n\nSPEAKER_00: it has been quite a journey i mean i keep reminding myself these are normal symptoms it does triggering it's triggering sometimes to be like is this normal fatigue or is this going back and you know are these headaches are they going to turn into migraines again you know but i keep reminding myself no it's normal to have headaches when you're pregnant it's normal to feel tired\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know and so i think in a way this experience is healing in itself because it's reminding me that i\n\nSPEAKER_00: do that our bodies are more amazing than we think that they are\n\nSPEAKER_00: and so it's been definitely an interesting experience yeah i can only imagine it's something that i experience even not being pregnant i imagine it's something we all experience to a certain extent we're just a bit i don't want to say paranoid but we've been through a lot so it's natural to question all these things and to get scared and have anxiety and is it coming back is this normal i thought i was better and it's a constant reminder i have to have for myself that getting better doesn't mean perfection nobody is nobody is perfect\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i mean normal healthy people get headaches healthy people have bad days and so i try to draw that line somewhere but you know i did get gestational diabetes with this pregnancy and i remind myself two of my husband's coworkers have gestate had gestation like but it's so hard when we are so used to our own trauma from this experience to not think oh no like something and probably go easy on ourselves for having those thoughts it's it's natural i think anyone's going to and i would hope and i would imagine that as time passes we'll get more and more comfortable with this and more used to just the regular ups and downs of life this has clearly been a massive ordeal that you've been through i always love knowing you know how this has changed you how it's impacted your life oh yeah i mean total different direction i thought i was going to have this full time career\n\nSPEAKER_00: occupational therapy and how i saw my identity how i valued myself was on my achievements and that was taken away and i had to realize that my value was deeper than that and people love me people want to help me i could learn to accept that\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i humbled me changed me i maybe was prideful before i wouldn't say i had a spirituality before relationship with god and it took me getting so sick and so desperate and exhausting all my options\n\nSPEAKER_00: willing to pray like the simplest thing which is free you're spending thousands and thousands on all these treatments and all these things and that changed me i never be the person i was before and i'm thankful for that appreciate life more i don't know quite how to put this but it's a bit of a conflicted relationship isn't it with illness because i think it really does bring a lot of good and it really changes us and it really catapults our growth and puts us in a better direction a lot of us anyways so you know it's something that is so horrible and so horrendous and you wouldn't wish on anybody but at the same time it's hard to imagine your life what it would be like if it hadn't gone that way it is really hard to describe what suffering does i mean this sometimes feels like i was in prison physically and then i'm set free trying to teach i only get one i only get one life\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is this life experience trying to teach me while i'm here how can i get the most out\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it is a perspective and an attitude too i mean you can choose to take things away from it or not it's happening either way there's no taking it away there's no choosing a life without it so we can either use it to shape us into someone better than we were before or not it sounds like you've definitely definitely gotten a lot out of this so good for you for doing all of this work and coming out of this in such a good place thank you it's exciting to see that in other people i love that i love hearing other people\n\nSPEAKER_00: it really is and there really are so many people that are getting past these things and i just i don't think we see enough of it it can be so discouraging to look online and see the prognosis for some of these illnesses but there are so many people who are getting better at various stages of recovery there's so much reason to be hopeful and i love that there's more and more stories like yours coming out and thank you so much for sharing yours because it just it makes a world of difference you know i remember when i first got sick i was trying to find recovery stories and i just couldn't find any this was twelve years ago or something i didn't hear of anyone getting better until i had gotten better\n\nSPEAKER_00: and then people other people start reaching out to me it's crazy we're just so shocked like hey so nice to meet you you recovered as well this is incredible\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it's just really nice it's really nice to see so if you could go back in time to when this first all happened i'm curious what you would tell yourself what would you have wanted to know at the beginning that you think could have helped you navigate this or at least been better prepared for what was to come i guess what we just said i think\n\nSPEAKER_00: that there are other people out there that have gotten better if i own that in the beginning i don't know my motivation i mean i was pretty motivated but man just knowing that would have just i was so defeated from day one when a doctor told me your life is over when i was first diagnosed fibromyalgia and they said this is it your life is over this is forever and i didn't want to believe that part of me rejected it but you can't unhear it so it messed with my mind and if i know no that's not true you can't limit a person's potential you don't know everything about chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia so how can you possibly have answers and for me now my faith it's like you cannot limit a limitless guy so i guess i would just tell myself to trust that process because i think i did have to go through all those years of research and learning i couldn't just skip ahead\n\nSPEAKER_00: to know what i know now i mean that took years that took years it was like going to getting a bachelor's degree and chronic illness so i don't know if there's\n\nSPEAKER_00: quick way through that of learning your body and learning what works specifically for you\n\nSPEAKER_00: but i guess i would just tell myself that it is very very possible\n\nSPEAKER_00: so perfectly put i've never heard that before like getting a bachelor's degree in chronic illness that is pretty much what all of us have to do i worked way harder at this recovery than any of my actual degrees you know you had to learn so much i think that is the most important point about the hope and not just hope but knowledge that people do get past it because that's it's the really the biggest part of the fuel because this is such a marathon it really is it's really hard it's exhausting it's a lot of work it's boring it's lonely it's stressful it's depressing and if you don't even know that it's actually possible i think most of us hold on to this deep hope within us like i will get past this i am determined but when you don't even know if it's possible most really bad days or weeks or months it's really hard to keep picking yourself back up important\n\nSPEAKER_00: to know watching people do get better we don't know you know what everyone's prognosis is and we don't know what everyone's journey is going to be so you obviously can't say for certain what's going to happen for everybody but i think exactly as you said we cannot put limits on it no one can put limits on your recovery thank you so much katie for sharing your story today it really is incredibly moving you know i've had goosebumps you brought me to tears it's just really wonderful how far you've come and it's so amazing to see you living this amazing life and happy and thriving and about to have your baby very soon so just thank you so much for sharing this with us today for asking me to do it it's my pleasure i love it i love what you're doing i'm so happy i got to meet liz and i've gotten to meet oh my goodness so many people it's i literally when i think about like us being in a room i probably would just cry\n\nSPEAKER_00: and like i would just high five people and hug people and cry and we survived we did it how amazing would that be i just it's just so i think about somebody i can picture somebody and they're bad just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i mean this would have been mind blowing to me to have i would have been like what and it's funny i don't i don't know if you get these types of messages too but people will be like how do you know you really had chronic fatigue\n\nSPEAKER_00: they can't wrap their head around someone could feel because they've been told so many times\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i'm like that's why the more pictures we can show them of people so it's not just me saying it a whole group of people stepping forward that it's like undeniable evidence yeah i definitely get that too you know that comments or people sort of like oh i'm not sure you ever really had it or you probably clearly you weren't all that sick or that doesn't actually work for chronic fatigue syndrome because no one can get better from that or most people aren't like that most people you know are there's a lot of positivity out there but you can understand the people who are jaded who are skeptical and they just can't wrap their head around it no this can't be you're not like me we're not the same that's not possible i don't know what's happening there but that's not it so i try not to be like defensive i'm like whatever i know my life like i don't have anything to prove that's such a good attitude to have and that's such a good way to look at it because i find it is easy to get defensive because sometimes it can feel like an attack and feel like you have to defend your illness which is not helping anything or anyone if people want to find you if they want to ask you questions or know more about you where can they find you i'm on instagram my handle is healing faithfully one word and i have a site where i share more details about my story and healing aspects it's called healing faithfully com and i do\n\nSPEAKER_00: called healing faithfully\n\nSPEAKER_00: the best way my email is actually on instagram\n\nSPEAKER_00: great and i'll have all of this listed in the video description so if anyone wants to take a look and find exactly the details it will all be there all right and for those of you watching as always we'd love to hear your thoughts we'd love to

copy the link and share it yourself or you can take a screenshot and share it on instagram let's get these stories out there let's keep the hope and inspiration\n\nSPEAKER_00: going and help one

here today because she is going to be sharing some of her journey with chronic illness which includes diagnosis for chronic fatigue syndrome as well as some other things i'll let her go into details of that but i'm just really excited to have you here welcome katie thank you for having me i'm so excited to meet with you and to be here i am really excited to hear more about your story and i'm so grateful and beyond impressed that you are willing and able to do this right now because i hope you don't mind my sharing but katie is thirty eight weeks pregnant as we speak\n\nSPEAKER_00: hopefully not during this interview but that would add some excitement\n\nSPEAKER_00: well you're a trooper thanks for doing us i hope your week goes well you induced on your wednesday getting induced on wednesday so very exciting your world is about to get even crazier\n\nSPEAKER_00: i'm excited that's the thing like life opened up and once we got better you know everyone must be feeling this like i got a second chance at life\n\nSPEAKER_00: everything i just like i don't even know because i couldn't even picture my future before i think it was too hard to dream or hope and now it's like who knows what will happen it's just amazing if i'm having even the slightest bad day i catch these moments and i have to catch myself and be like you are a walking miracle like this is incredible you are living something that you dreamed about every day for years like your life is a dream whatever it is that's stressing you out does not matter it does not matter yeah absolutely and it's it's funny that's one of my prayers is may i never forget may i never forget and become\n\nSPEAKER_00: no offense but like a normal person\n\nSPEAKER_00: who takes it for granted i never forget because that joy is so enlivening and it's like every day it's like you're winning the race every day you're like yes\n\nSPEAKER_00: it's like being like when you watch a six year old wandering through the world and they're just like a flower a tree a puppy\n\nSPEAKER_00: these new eyes where you just get to almost be childlike again and just really appreciate things so much so yeah i hope it doesn't go away yeah i don't think i don't think it will but it's something i do think about often\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think i'll appreciate this it is hard though to have friends who've never been through it like most of my friends have obviously never been through it and they complain about their lives and i just feel such a detachment sometimes it is hard\n\nSPEAKER_00: as much as it probably was hard for them to be my friend through it sometimes it's hard for me to be their friend now because i'm like you have it all\n\nSPEAKER_00: i really struggle with people who probably we all have our triggers but people who seem physically able to go to the gym but just choose not to\n\nSPEAKER_00: it was the worst for me when i was sick like i would give anything to because i love working out so that's one of my things that i really miss so when i can see people who could and just did it of course i don't know their life and i don't know what they're facing and they've got their own reasons and limitations i have no clue what's going on in their world but yes i know i know exactly what you mean i felt that way about people who complain about work and i'm like that's all i want to be able to do like i was my life and my identity but yeah you're right you know people are entitled to complain about their lives yeah their problems are real\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does change things so it is nice to just connect with other people who kind of had this experience just before we dive in as i always say i'm not a medical professional katie is an occupational therapist so she is a medical professional but neither one of us are for sure your medical professionals at the moment so we're just sharing our own personal experience of living with and recovering from chronic illness so certainly nothing of what we share should be considered medical advice my story actually begins in childhood actually because i did have some major infection that impacted my ability to go to school and i was in the hospital no one knew really was wrong and the reason bring that up it's because it's relevant to later it was constant fungal infections in my stomach intestines and the doctor find it a lot of times couldn't treat it it's believed that some of that stuff may have triggered my genetic condition i did recover from that so i knew healing was possible and it wasn't until twenty fourteen that i actually started experience chronic fatigue symptoms where i couldn't walk i just wasn't recovering sleep so i would be working for about every i don't know two to four months and then i would end up collapsing and i just couldn't recover fully so anytime i did a strenuous task i would have that sort of\n\nSPEAKER_00: price to pay so to speak so that's when i knew something was more serious and started to investigate it and try to heal so what happened when you initially went to the doctors what did they say i was initially diagnosed with fibromyalgia they completely ignored the ability that i was having a hard time moving against gravity and fatigued they really missed the fatigue so it took a while before i even got the chronic fatigue diagnosis but no one would even really treat it i don't think they really what to do they looked at just blood work ology it just really i wasn't really getting care for it for many years yeah unfortunately such a common story i'm sure you've seen as well it seems to be the same for so many of us in the beginning not a lot of answers not a lot of help so what did you do well i kept rehabilitate myself being an occupational therapist and leaving that possible because childhood experience i just\n\nSPEAKER_00: researching doctors researching as much as i could and then eventually i moved from new york city back home to buffalo and that's where i got linked with some really great doctors first an integrated nurse practitioner\n\nSPEAKER_00: level of investigative blood work that i was not used to i call her the blood detective she was looking at underlying infections candida epstein barr virus real infections and she went out helped me to go after that and for a while that actually made me worse it was pretty brutal treatment she would try to build my body up but at the same time it was getting down these infections i could for some reason never my body just couldn't fight and that was the missing link why couldn't my body fight these infections other people have epstein barr virus and they recover what was it about my body that was the missing link that's what brought me to my other doctor who's an immunologist and probably the most brilliant man i know and he started looking at genetic conditions that have to do with metabolic myopathies and mitochondrial dysfunction and what direction did he suggest going for that or what where did you take it from there so i had full genetic or full genome testing done and i did find that i have mitochondrial disease called mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome eleven and when i read about it it was like tears down my face because it's like targets the diaphragm i was like this is it finally and he put me on the cocktail which helped basically my body wasn't producing mitochondria i could never fight infections my body strength to fight so by him supplementing and boosting my mitochondria i could now fight the infections that i was trying for probably like a year and a half prior and when you came together it was like\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow before you got this what were your days like or what were your weeks like oh my goodness i was working on a master's degree which you know is a lot it's a lot of work there full days i was doing clinical rotations i had friends i went out almost every night of the week i don't even know how i didn't look good in school i love to socialize i love to go out i traveled i lived in colorado i lived in philadelphia new york city i'm sure everyone was shocked when i got just not something that anyone probably could have predicted or coming wasn't at all like my childhood experience it's completely different yeah it sounds like it came on pretty suddenly it seems like that but when i look back i think that there were some signs that i was stressed i had been in graduate school i'd been in a stressful relationship a toxic relationship i was just probably overworking myself i was living in new york city working very long hours i was a traveling therapist at one point so i was walking i was working ten hour days walking from one end of manhattan to the other end of manhattan i'm warning signs i wasn't necessarily the healthiest person\n\nSPEAKER_00: so many things it just really seems like so many of us have so much of the same you know it seems like it comes on suddenly but when we look back we see we have pretty much i mean i'm sure it's not everybody but i imagine you've noticed the same really pushing it not taking such good care of ourselves but on the surface we look so vibrant so healthy we're always on the go we might be working out a lot you know just very social happy looking people so you went from obviously being very active you know very engaged in life when you got sick what did that look like what did your days and your weeks look like after that for those for that first year however long before you started getting the help that you needed the first year was kind of basically me living in denial i would continue to try to work and people would pull me aside like this is dangerous\n\nSPEAKER_00: because i was also working with patients i was i was scared i rob people i was scared i hurt people i felt an ethical responsibility it just wasn't safe i didn't feel safe riding the subway home because i thought i'd fall asleep or pass out and wake up and not know but it was very difficult to do grocery shopping so i just kept trying and then\n\nSPEAKER_00: it took me a while to realize that this was serious and that it needed a full time job so eventually you had to quit your job and focus on getting your health back what are some other things that have contributed to your recovery i would say lifestyle modification i had to dramatically change my diet through i had to do basically an elimination diet first to figure out what was causing basically use food as medicine as a mindset of healing and then i also had to really work on rehab through movement and for me that's really important because i can't get my cells oxygen if i'm not so i know movement is a very hot topic and it is very controversial because it's not done properly but i had to\n\nSPEAKER_00: gradually increase my ability to\n\nSPEAKER_00: and then also i removed all toxic ingredients immunotoxic i\n\nSPEAKER_00: water filtration system on my house i just the lengths which i went to and it really helped my so you mentioned diet played a big role and it seems that a lot of us find this and i'm curious what diet changes ended up helping for you not because i think necessarily it's the key for anyone else but i think it's good for people to see that there are different paths to health through diet for people and it is very much individual so i'm curious for you what ended up being your what did your body respond to well the three main offenders that were pretty obvious before i even did the elimination diet were dairy gluten and sugar and then from there i tried many different diets i did find for me i needed a high protein meat based diet i don't know if that's\n\nSPEAKER_00: mitochondrial disease but when i tried vegetarian i had a hard time with beans i had a hard time with soy and so i struggled with some of those components of it so i found that some nightshades bother me i don't know if i'm familiar with nightshades but i did have a problem with those for a while nightshades that's things like what is that is that tomatoes and bell peppers or what is yes it's tomato potatoes eggplant the one i can't take i can't tolerate anymore i can't see the funny thing when i did the elimination diet and i gave my body a break to heal i slowly could incorporate those things back in without being as inflamed over time so it's kind of scary at first you're like what am i going to have left but eggs were bothering me for a while they don't bother me\n\nSPEAKER_00: just took some things out for a while gave my body that chance to heal and slowly would incorporate them and sometimes they did offend me still and sometimes they did well that's encouraging that you didn't have to cut everything out forever because that is a bit of a scary prognosis to look at for your life like how eating is just going to be stressful forever it was stressful and it's very hard to do i did it as a last resort after years of suffering it wasn't my first\n\nSPEAKER_00: trying to do that it is very hard\n\nSPEAKER_00: from my husband and my mom and help because i was honestly too sick to cook for myself and with those types of restrictions it's just hard to meal plan hard to it's a hard process and for me it also required i think i hear you saying the same thing but just a level of desperation because it is hard but you get to a point where you're so desperate you just need you'll do just about anything to get your health back so all of a sudden what felt unthinkable is suddenly doable and another thing that helped me because for a while i tried really hard to get my diet in order but i would cheat and fall off and then come back to it before i really got serious as time rolled on and i could see that i wasn't getting my life back i was going to have to get more serious but another thing sugar we all mentioned seem to mention sugar and sugar was a massive one for me and sugar was a tough one for me not just because i liked it and i didn't want to get rid of it because i clearly had a physical addiction it was intense i would get up in the middle of the night every single night and eat sugar like there was something happening i would sometimes take a spoon\n\nSPEAKER_01: and eat it right out of the\n\nSPEAKER_00: canister like it was insane so for me it was healing my gut getting more probiotics and i always thought it was a willpower thing i was just weak and i just why can't i stop i know this is bad for me but once my body started healing the cravings went away i think the desperation combined with the body starting to heal and get a bit more imbalance so those cravings go away and it all becomes a bit more doable it does become a bit more doable it's really hard at first and i had i have memories of being a little kid and like going in the corner and like eating treats like nonstop and bread i was obsessed with\n\nSPEAKER_00: eating that infection and there was some sort of addiction there and i mean it's very it's very hard to fight fight that but once i got broke through you're right i didn't feel those cravings the same way and doesn't it just feel like freedom i thought i was going to have to face this the rest of my life i thought my whole life was going to be a battle with food because it really was before i got sick and it's just incredible to have this healthy relationship with food where it's not a battle and you're not trying to force yourself to eat the right things okay so i just want to make sure i'm catching all of this so for you the main things\n\nSPEAKER_00: could you summarize for us what were the main things that worked for you for your recovery the main things that worked there's something\n\nSPEAKER_00: i did have to go back and heal trauma i had to do some spiritual healing so some mind body work i had to modify my diet i had to create some sort of movement routine that worked for my body that i could tolerate and not decline with and i had to remove all environmental toxins yeah it sounds very similar to my journey as well and i think it's good using the word movement and this was one of the mistakes i think when i talk about my recovery journey as i call it exercise and when people hear exercise they picture at the gym or going for a run but when i'm talking about my exercise program it was so small you know it was one to two minutes a day and in the beginning not even every single day and it was just really gentle movement because i think you're right it is definitely a sensitive topic and with good reason because full blown exercise can put people in the hospital even just three or four minutes of it and wrapping your head around i gotta get this lymph moving to reduce i have to put i have to and i have to get oxygen and nutrients to my cells and that happens through movement\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it's confusing because we're trying to get in sync with our body and listen to our body which is part of this journey but a big part of the message is our body is telling us some of the time it's just don't move but i found i couldn't rest my way out of this i couldn't just lay in bed or lay on the couch all day i was never going to get better i tried that for a long time and it didn't get me anywhere i agree i did the same thing so it's great there are so many things that did work for you were there some things that you tried that didn't work for you and what were they\n\nSPEAKER_00: that doesn't work chasing symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_00: i was in pain for a long time whether it was taking this pill taking this supplement everyone always wants to know what supplements i'm on and i'm going to real honest the supplements i take are based on my blood work and my genetic profile they're not necessarily applicable to else it doesn't\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i don't think supplements are the cure clearly the supplements i take are supporting metabolic disease i have where my body\n\nSPEAKER_00: so idea that there's going to be a quick\n\nSPEAKER_00: pill just chasing symptoms i mean you do need symptoms and it's one of the best things i ever did\n\nSPEAKER_00: one of the best things you did was go off coffee\n\nSPEAKER_00: hormonally helped rebalance my hormones healed my gut and also i have such good energy throughout the day it just it was it was shooting up my cortisol too much and rocking my just my adrenals so it made it made a big impact but for a while i was like quick fix like this\n\nSPEAKER_00: it seems like almost cruel advice for someone with chronic fatigue syndrome to say to stop having coffee what do you mean it's just the only thing that makes me feel better but it makes me feel better at least for me in the moment but it put me on such a roller coaster it messed up my blood sugar in time came to realize that big part of my afternoon crashes was just the caffeine crash and it's not a regular person caffeine crash with cfs it seems to be amplified it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah and it's a good point about the symptoms too i think we're all kind of brought up to chase symptoms you know we treat things one at a time we look at our body like a car you know fix little parts individually and i agree i think it's a balance you do have to treat some of them you know like for me i wasn't sleeping and i did all the things under the sun that you're supposed to do and it just wasn't working so for a while i had to take some you know prescription sedatives and like you had i had to target some symptoms individually but in the end what seems to pull its weight is looking at things in a more holistic viewpoint i agree and i had insomnia too and i had to take medication and i'm not against that but i'm talking about yeah overall healing yeah yeah when people ask things like you know what supplement should i take for brain fog or what should i do for you know whatever pain in my body and it's it's really hard i can't break any of it most of it down there wasn't specific things i did that worked for specific symptoms it was just slowly pulling my body out of all of it so i actually get some people messaging me or commenting on videos that are wanting to get pregnant or thinking about having a child and that actually naturally brings up a lot of stuff for them i don't have any children so i don't have anything to offer on this but i'm curious for you what has this process been like this pregnancy with your history of illness\n\nSPEAKER_00: well if you told me two years ago that i'd be pregnant i would have thought that that's crazy\n\nSPEAKER_00: like i was literally almost on my deathbed two years ago i could never have imagined this future i could have never imagined well enough because i didn't want to be a burden more of a burden to my husband i didn't want the financial responsibility i didn't think i could be a good mom i didn't want to\n\nSPEAKER_00: with that watch that so it was not even thought about and then when i got better so quickly heal and heal from endometriosis all these other things i was like well i kind of i have a good relationship with god right i was like well what's next what do you want from me and i did feel i gave my life over so i realized that was the one area i was holding back because i was still i didn't want to live in fear\n\nSPEAKER_00: because there's not a lot of research out there doctors couldn't make any promises to me\n\nSPEAKER_00: you'll be fine and i'm like\n\nSPEAKER_00: pregnant and so that set me on a course of learning how to give up control in a whole nother way and\n\nSPEAKER_00: it has been quite a journey i mean i keep reminding myself these are normal symptoms it does triggering it's triggering sometimes to be like is this normal fatigue or is this going back and you know are these headaches are they going to turn into migraines again you know but i keep reminding myself no it's normal to have headaches when you're pregnant it's normal to feel tired\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know and so i think in a way this experience is healing in itself because it's reminding me that i\n\nSPEAKER_00: do that our bodies are more amazing than we think that they are\n\nSPEAKER_00: and so it's been definitely an interesting experience yeah i can only imagine it's something that i experience even not being pregnant i imagine it's something we all experience to a certain extent we're just a bit i don't want to say paranoid but we've been through a lot so it's natural to question all these things and to get scared and have anxiety and is it coming back is this normal i thought i was better and it's a constant reminder i have to have for myself that getting better doesn't mean perfection nobody is nobody is perfect\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i mean normal healthy people get headaches healthy people have bad days and so i try to draw that line somewhere but you know i did get gestational diabetes with this pregnancy and i remind myself two of my husband's coworkers have gestate had gestation like but it's so hard when we are so used to our own trauma from this experience to not think oh no like something and probably go easy on ourselves for having those thoughts it's it's natural i think anyone's going to and i would hope and i would imagine that as time passes we'll get more and more comfortable with this and more used to just the regular ups and downs of life this has clearly been a massive ordeal that you've been through i always love knowing you know how this has changed you how it's impacted your life oh yeah i mean total different direction i thought i was going to have this full time career\n\nSPEAKER_00: occupational therapy and how i saw my identity how i valued myself was on my achievements and that was taken away and i had to realize that my value was deeper than that and people love me people want to help me i could learn to accept that\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i humbled me changed me i maybe was prideful before i wouldn't say i had a spirituality before relationship with god and it took me getting so sick and so desperate and exhausting all my options\n\nSPEAKER_00: willing to pray like the simplest thing which is free you're spending thousands and thousands on all these treatments and all these things and that changed me i never be the person i was before and i'm thankful for that appreciate life more i don't know quite how to put this but it's a bit of a conflicted relationship isn't it with illness because i think it really does bring a lot of good and it really changes us and it really catapults our growth and puts us in a better direction a lot of us anyways so you know it's something that is so horrible and so horrendous and you wouldn't wish on anybody but at the same time it's hard to imagine your life what it would be like if it hadn't gone that way it is really hard to describe what suffering does i mean this sometimes feels like i was in prison physically and then i'm set free trying to teach i only get one i only get one life\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is this life experience trying to teach me while i'm here how can i get the most out\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it is a perspective and an attitude too i mean you can choose to take things away from it or not it's happening either way there's no taking it away there's no choosing a life without it so we can either use it to shape us into someone better than we were before or not it sounds like you've definitely definitely gotten a lot out of this so good for you for doing all of this work and coming out of this in such a good place thank you it's exciting to see that in other people i love that i love hearing other people\n\nSPEAKER_00: it really is and there really are so many people that are getting past these things and i just i don't think we see enough of it it can be so discouraging to look online and see the prognosis for some of these illnesses but there are so many people who are getting better at various stages of recovery there's so much reason to be hopeful and i love that there's more and more stories like yours coming out and thank you so much for sharing yours because it just it makes a world of difference you know i remember when i first got sick i was trying to find recovery stories and i just couldn't find any this was twelve years ago or something i didn't hear of anyone getting better until i had gotten better\n\nSPEAKER_00: and then people other people start reaching out to me it's crazy we're just so shocked like hey so nice to meet you you recovered as well this is incredible\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it's just really nice it's really nice to see so if you could go back in time to when this first all happened i'm curious what you would tell yourself what would you have wanted to know at the beginning that you think could have helped you navigate this or at least been better prepared for what was to come i guess what we just said i think\n\nSPEAKER_00: that there are other people out there that have gotten better if i own that in the beginning i don't know my motivation i mean i was pretty motivated but man just knowing that would have just i was so defeated from day one when a doctor told me your life is over when i was first diagnosed fibromyalgia and they said this is it your life is over this is forever and i didn't want to believe that part of me rejected it but you can't unhear it so it messed with my mind and if i know no that's not true you can't limit a person's potential you don't know everything about chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia so how can you possibly have answers and for me now my faith it's like you cannot limit a limitless guy so i guess i would just tell myself to trust that process because i think i did have to go through all those years of research and learning i couldn't just skip ahead\n\nSPEAKER_00: to know what i know now i mean that took years that took years it was like going to getting a bachelor's degree and chronic illness so i don't know if there's\n\nSPEAKER_00: quick way through that of learning your body and learning what works specifically for you\n\nSPEAKER_00: but i guess i would just tell myself that it is very very possible\n\nSPEAKER_00: so perfectly put i've never heard that before like getting a bachelor's degree in chronic illness that is pretty much what all of us have to do i worked way harder at this recovery than any of my actual degrees you know you had to learn so much i think that is the most important point about the hope and not just hope but knowledge that people do get past it because that's it's the really the biggest part of the fuel because this is such a marathon it really is it's really hard it's exhausting it's a lot of work it's boring it's lonely it's stressful it's depressing and if you don't even know that it's actually possible i think most of us hold on to this deep hope within us like i will get past this i am determined but when you don't even know if it's possible most really bad days or weeks or months it's really hard to keep picking yourself back up important\n\nSPEAKER_00: to know watching people do get better we don't know you know what everyone's prognosis is and we don't know what everyone's journey is going to be so you obviously can't say for certain what's going to happen for everybody but i think exactly as you said we cannot put limits on it no one can put limits on your recovery thank you so much katie for sharing your story today it really is incredibly moving you know i've had goosebumps you brought me to tears it's just really wonderful how far you've come and it's so amazing to see you living this amazing life and happy and thriving and about to have your baby very soon so just thank you so much for sharing this with us today for asking me to do it it's my pleasure i love it i love what you're doing i'm so happy i got to meet liz and i've gotten to meet oh my goodness so many people it's i literally when i think about like us being in a room i probably would just cry\n\nSPEAKER_00: and like i would just high five people and hug people and cry and we survived we did it how amazing would that be i just it's just so i think about somebody i can picture somebody and they're bad just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i mean this would have been mind blowing to me to have i would have been like what and it's funny i don't i don't know if you get these types of messages too but people will be like how do you know you really had chronic fatigue\n\nSPEAKER_00: they can't wrap their head around someone could feel because they've been told so many times\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i'm like that's why the more pictures we can show them of people so it's not just me saying it a whole group of people stepping forward that it's like undeniable evidence yeah i definitely get that too you know that comments or people sort of like oh i'm not sure you ever really had it or you probably clearly you weren't all that sick or that doesn't actually work for chronic fatigue syndrome because no one can get better from that or most people aren't like that most people you know are there's a lot of positivity out there but you can understand the people who are jaded who are skeptical and they just can't wrap their head around it no this can't be you're not like me we're not the same that's not possible i don't know what's happening there but that's not it so i try not to be like defensive i'm like whatever i know my life like i don't have anything to prove that's such a good attitude to have and that's such a good way to look at it because i find it is easy to get defensive because sometimes it can feel like an attack and feel like you have to defend your illness which is not helping anything or anyone if people want to find you if they want to ask you questions or know more about you where can they find you i'm on instagram my handle is healing faithfully one word and i have a site where i share more details about my story and healing aspects it's

that there is a way out many people have recovered from this and are now thriving hi everyone i'm raylan if you're new here welcome on this channel we share insights knowledge and resources that we have learned to be helpful with conditions like mecfs and long covid so how do we know these things we've learned it from the more than a hundred and fifty recorded recovery interviews right here on the channel i'm excited to have frances goodall with us today all the way over in sheffield in the uk francis has an incredible story of overcoming mecfs and has used her knowledge to help others to also return to living fully like she does today as a working mom and an outdoor enthusiast who has even completed three half marathons so let's dive right in and welcome francis francis so amazing to have you here thank you for doing this today oh thank you for having me on your wonderful channel so take us back what was happening around the time when you first became unwell\n\nSPEAKER_00: so when i first became unwell i was quite young i was only nineteen i was at university and i was doing all of the things you know i had a job i was studying hard i joined all the different societies i possibly could join and you know developed a new friendship group and was going out a lot and then suddenly one day i was on my way to do some voluntary work and i just yeah just didn't feel well at all didn't know what was going on felt a bit fluy felt a bit strange felt a bit scared because it felt really weird and then yeah that was the start of it really i ended up not being able to continue my university studies ended up having to come back home and live with my mom and i think it probably took about six i think it took six months to get a chronic fatigue or me diagnosis\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah you can tell when someone went through this a while ago you know it wasn't last year the year before because i feel like we developed this ability to just zoom through that one of the most intense experiences of our life like yeah so i became unwell and then i had to drop on a university\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know that had to be a really scary thing at such a young age you know when you got started not feeling well and didn't get better what were you thinking\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i was well i also got i had a doctor wanted to diagnose me as being depressed not being the main issue as well like very early on but i knew it wasn't just depression i knew there was emotion about feeling unwell and you know i was emotionally challenged by that was probably getting depressed by that but i knew there was something else going on so yeah it was really scary time definitely a time that i feel like i've grieved and worked with as i healed you know at the other end which is probably why i can talk about it so lightly now but yeah at the time it was really really scary and i didn't know what was happening i didn't know what to do yeah and at first i kind of gave up it i went home and was kind of even doing things like watching daytime television and just feeling a bit low and you know all my friends from home had gone to university all my friends from university were still at university so initially i didn't really have anyone there other than my family and yeah it was a very tough time\n\nSPEAKER_01: so doctors told you that the cause of all this was depression\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah one of the first doctors said she just thought i was depressed that was it\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i think a lot of us hear that and it's i think a little bit infuriating i can see how they come to that conclusion because we likely are depressed but that wasn't for most of us the first thing takeaway pitch that was ability to function in the world and anyone's going to be depressed yeah so what did you do did you just start googling or how did you start to try and figure your way out of this\n\nSPEAKER_00: in the year before i got ill i had also traveled the world before going to university and i had got really interested in meditation and buddhism and yoga a little bit as well so i thought i did think quite early on well perhaps meditation and yoga can help me heal so i did start quite early on doing a little bit of meditation yoga a little bit of breath work like for instance i remember one time doing the alternate nostril breathing and noticing i felt different after doing it so or doing a relaxation oh yeah i often listen to relaxations as well guided relaxations and then doing them sometimes i'd notice i felt considerably better after doing one so that those sorts of experiences quite early on gave me some hope that there was something i could do about getting myself better but often it was just like feeling better for a little bit and then i'd feel much worse again you know so it took a long time to learn to really get a deeper shift or to yeah well took five years to get fully well but it was a very up and down journey as well yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i imagine you tried some things over those years that didn't work what were some of those things\n\nSPEAKER_00: well for example quite early on i remember going to an acupuncturist who had written an article that said me and my me chronic fatigue recovery cure and i was like oh this is going to be the thing that's going to cure me so i had some acupuncture and she gave me some herbs as well which just tasted so bad and no it's not like against acupuncture because i love it and over the years it has been good since then and it did help it did help on some ways on my journey but that particular acupuncture or series of sessions didn't seem to do anything for me at that point but maybe it just wasn't the right thing at that point you know but later on i do think acupuncture did help a little bit i'm not quite anything against chinese medicine or acupuncture but it was yeah that didn't didn't particularly do anything in those early stages i'm trying to remember i mean i would at some point i started like trying one therapy after another you know i'd go for reiki and i'd go for this and i go for that and you know try different kinds of alternative therapies i went to a nutritional therapist she did colonic irrigation but i didn't even know apparently i brought in chronic irrigation but she gave me some nutrition advice and i do think i did have a you know like a candida issue as well so that perhaps was somewhat helpful to learn a bit about the body and things like candida imbalances and things like that but at the same time it wasn't that helpful i don't think yeah i don't know that makes sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: irrigation was that like colon hydrotherapy\n\nSPEAKER_00: they put water up you and like flush out your system yeah i've never had it done i didn't go for it but it was so in a way it was kind of funny that i hadn't even booked in for this session but i didn't think i had i thought i'd booked in to see a nutritional therapist again because my dad had told me that she'd helped cure someone of chronic fatigue you know so it was like following these different things these different lines of possibility for hope and a cure\n\nSPEAKER_01: i ended up doing colon hydrotherapy as one of the zillion things i tried to get well and did you keep watching if you've never tried it you haven't lived experience fully i think funny though i ended up meeting one of my best friends ever she was my colon hydrotherapist i think you just bond really quickly like you get past all the small talk once you're anyways it's the stuff that we all tried well it's just it's yeah that level of desperation\n\nSPEAKER_00: as well before even all this you know cold therapy that it's about these days but back then i remember reading an article about how cold can help me and i'd lying cold baths and i did often feel better afterwards i mean over there lying in a cold bath trying to get myself well yeah it's quite funny\n\nSPEAKER_01: i know you think about it we're going through this incredible suffering we have all these scary symptoms and then we're getting hoses put up our bums and laying in breathing full bath tubs it's like as if the suffering isn't enough we just kind of just desperate like okay if it even works for one person i gotta try it it's amazing that everyone i talked to your mind just suddenly becomes very open\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah i would try one thing and then the next thing and the next thing and i even flew to america i mean i'm in the uk and i flew to the us to florida to work with a healer that apparently had healed quite a few people of chronic fatigue as well so yeah just like loads of things i was i was so desperate to be well and to figure out what was going on\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah okay so eventually you did start to find some things that did help so what did that look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah well actually well two years into the illness i was doing a lot of meditation and i had an experience of meditation of a lot of energy flowing through my body and then i felt amazing like i felt like something had shifted but actually i ended up in quite an unstable kind of up and down process for three more years after that but i did think i was cured after two years through this meditation experience which is a bit mad but i was a bit intense about my meditation practice and i think i did have a kind of a release of energy but it was just not sustainable and yeah i still had a lot of things to figure out in myself but the things like towards the end of the recovery journey i read a book on reverse therapy and nickel therapy they were two practitioners i think that around the time they were working together at one point around reverse therapy and then they split off and did their own thing but i think i read both of their books and yeah something in that was like a bit of a light bulb for me about one of the key things i realized in myself was i had a massive pattern of like avoiding conflict at all costs like i could not possibly share something that might upset somebody else so i would just shut down and i think recognizing that pattern was one of the key parts for me to be able to get better and to sustain my health and i also didn't realize but i had quite a bit of suppressed anger and unresolved trauma in my system that i didn't realize was there\n\nSPEAKER_00: kind of started to come through in the various workshops and therapy sessions and coaching sessions i had during the five years to try and heal\n\nSPEAKER_01: okay so you mentioned two things there reverse therapy and mcale therapy so the first one reverse therapy what does that look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah they're very similar i can't remember the exact difference but it was about looking at symptoms and getting curious about symptoms and what is there an emotion underlying this symptom that's what i remember from it and starting to like really check in with myself and you know try and be more in tune with what was actually going on for me emotionally and yeah so that was a massive part i mean looking back i do think and all the research i've done around trauma i do think a lot of it for me was the impact of trauma on my system manifesting physically like a freeze response i don't know if you thought your perspective on that kind of stuff is but because even after i got better sometimes i'd go a little bit like a bit fatigue again and then i'd have to kind of work on something and then i'd feel back to normal again so it was yeah for me a lot of it when i look back i think was what's to do with the freeze response in my nervous system\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it's definitely a theme i couldn't begin to count how many people who have said something similar in their interview about that being a key piece of their recovery and it seems to be a core component of many recovery approaches like dr john sarno we hear a lot about his tms approach and lots of that theme of it's so mind blowing to me this is i think one of the most fascinating topics to me is how much those repressed emotions and that unresolved trauma can impact our nervous system and our brain and create all these symptoms and how much so many of us don't realize in our modern day society that we're walking around feeling like we are suppressing these things these feelings of anger and rage like i don't know i need to be a certain kind of person as a woman or a mother or a father or i need to be okay with working seventy hours a week or you know i have shame around this or it's not okay to feel this way or it's not okay to express my emotions and just by tampering all that down for all these years you know our system starts to recognize those feelings as scary and bad and it's fascinating how the body creates all these symptoms as a new distraction or is it because it's being hypersensitive or whatever the different theories are just understanding that and bringing that into light very impact for a lot of people yes\n\nSPEAKER_00: i mean i have one really strong example where i started to really understand the mind body connection you know i was with a group of people we were doing we were actually doing reiki on each other like a reiki share my boyfriend was there i was making tea for everyone my boyfriend was getting triggered because he thought i was going to tire myself out by doing too much and that he was going to have to pick up the pieces afterwards and then i was getting angry with him because you know because i felt like he wasn't trusting me and but i think it was just triggering some old stuff as well and then like i couldn't handle the anger so i remember just being like can't feel this i don't know what to do with it so just shut it down but then i could hardly walk and then i had to just lie down on the sofa and then he said something again that triggered me again and i just ran upstairs he said oh see i told you this is going to happen and i was like not because of that it's because i've done what to do with it yeah one moment the next moment i could run up the stairs i was like okay yeah this is really odd yeah what\n\nSPEAKER_01: did that look like for you starting to understand this mind body connection so what does that mean for starting to feel better and come out of this what does that look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah well i think a lot of it looked like learning to be more myself more authentic you know learning to express myself more authentically i remember learning non violent communication so i felt like when i had a bit of a way that i could communicate my feelings without it also being too much for someone else which i think initially because i had been so suppressed things would come out quite strongly at first you know like i remember alex howard i trained with him in coaching and he was talking about the pendulum that can swing from being you know very repressed to then the other way or a pendulum can swing from being one way to the other way and it's almost like coming back into balance again so i did notice that it was almost like i went from being so suppressed to then quite reactive and then had to learn how to be able to be authentic with people communicate my needs my feelings you know it's okay to have needs you know all these kind of things and but also to do things like continue to look after myself and you know prioritize time in nature prioritize time with friends prioritize self care as well as you know once i was better start developing my work and stepping into the world of work again after a long time of not being in the world of work but doing it in a way that was you know trying to be as balanced as possible and not too yeah not too out of balance yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's so interesting that so many of us go on this journey let's call it i mean it is a journey but can be very tough tough tough experience becoming so unwell and for many people last years it ends up being this teacher about how to like you said be more authentic take better care of yourself it is an amazing teacher and you know most people do come out the other side of it so much happier and more content and at peace and better equipped to deal with their life and their emotions and their health and the world it's it's fascinating i don't think most of us if you told us that coming into it we probably think you were crazy because it sounds even after doing all these interviews and i know it's true i know this is the case for so many people it's still every time i hear it my head kind of explodes you know yeah you're so sick it was like you need to lead a more authentic life yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: it definitely wouldn't have made sense when i first started to get sick but looking back i can be in a way i can be grateful for how much i learned through that journey of you know getting sick and figuring out how to be well again yeah how much so much learning so you've\n\nSPEAKER_01: talked about before or we talked about before this call preparing for this but you know the spiritual elements of your healing journey so can you talk a little bit about that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i don't know if you've had an old channel who shared anything like this i have had the odd client that's come to me with this but i also had a kundalini or spiritual some kind of spiritual awakening during my healing journey which is i think why the ups and downs were so intense i think i also there was also kind of trauma element of it like dissociation like coming out of my body definitely was part of the condition for me and part of what i had to work with afterwards was to learn really how to be in my body and i think spiritually i found something like meditation where i could have these really beautiful experiences sometimes i felt like i left my body and i was like connecting with the whole universe and you know it felt really amazing but then i but then i was really struggling to function in my life and my health was still all over the place you know sometimes i'd feel well and other times i crash again things like that so the spiritual element was an important element of my journey and yeah it's hard to describe it but i have also witnessed some other people who have also had that experience so it's kind of yeah happy to talk a little bit about that element of my journey yeah and i got deeply into meditation you know was reading so many books about buddhism and meditation and sometimes i was meditating at times when i was sick three hours a day and i actually got to the point where i had to stop meditating for a while because i was kind of using it in the wrong way i was using it to sort of escape everyday reality and have these mystical experiences but then actually finding it harder to function in everyday reality so i had to sort of yeah learn to do normal things for a while and connect with nature and you know be able to have a normal conversation i think after like a five year healing journey and then all the spiritual experience as well it was it was like yeah i just found normal life a challenge to integrate back into that makes sense that's a really\n\nSPEAKER_01: good point yeah because then once you're well and feeling better the rat race the world is waiting for you and\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that haven't been through what you've been through especially at such a young age i imagine just emotionally matured much more rapidly than most of us do at that time period in our lives probably challenging to you know connect or just see where this how this all fits together yeah sounds like this\n\nSPEAKER_01: changed you a lot clearly this whole experience has changed you a lot what has life been like since you've been well\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i mean life has been good overall i mean overall i feel like i've learned how to have experience a lot of joy a lot of inner peace you know i have a great community yeah i've had a child i've got a son who's ten yeah and life's been rich and great and i've you know done lots of different kinds of therapeutic and coaching trainings and been working in this field myself nearly twenty years so yeah there's been lots of great things i've run half marathons i think i did what partly want to prove like to the world of myself i am fully well you know yeah so yeah life's been life's been good and i feel like i've definitely learned so much through that time that shifted things for a deep level for me and also kept me interested in personal growth you know because i was like well how you know doing some emotional work and spiritual work and heal chronic fatigue and where else can i go with this you know how much joy can i create in this lifetime how much ease can i create and yeah so i do keep up quite a few of the practices that support me to heal and new practices you know always learning new things and do feel like i'm a lifelong learner as well i'm always fascinated by learning new things\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i was listening to you talk like how do i have more you in my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: this is i'm so inspired by how this has changed you and just the spiritual development and yeah that continuous growth i'm curious because a lot of us think of recovery from these conditions like there's a finish line where that chapter ends and then the rest of your life starts yeah but in reality a lot of people find it's more of an ongoing journey so what's that been like for you is there self care things you need to still do you know is there any part of you that's worried about you know becoming unwell again what's life kind of post recovery been for you\n\nSPEAKER_00: i mean it has been a really long time now so yeah it's been maybe seventeen years since i'd say the five years was up but in those years you know especially in the lesser in recent years but definitely sort of my later twenties early thirties i did have periodically sort of what i would now describe even back then i didn't always understand it would be like trauma type symptoms would come up like i'd feel a bit shut down or a bit dissociated and i wouldn't know why and then i'd have to go and do some work on myself with a practitioner or perhaps i'd go and spend some nighttime in nature and that would regulate me but i did have to quite yeah quite regularly kind of figure out how to regulate myself again when things were out of balance and that can still happen today but not to the extent it was still happening in my sort of late twenties early thirties and not as often so yeah but that was when i yeah i guess sort of started to see that it wasn't all about being chronically sick and definitely wasn't about being chronic sick anymore like i don't worry about that and i didn't worry about that i mean maybe a little bit in the early stages because i was a bit kind of like oh i've been ill for all these years now i need to make up for it i need to go and help at these retreats that i used to go and just receive i need to go and do all these things and i need to get this message of healing out into the world and you know and there was a bit of a kind of pushy energy and all of that sometimes but overall no i never worry about getting chronically sick again with chronic fatigue yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah amazing clearly this also shifted or influenced your career trajectory so you tell us a bit about that\n\nSPEAKER_00: well yeah yeah so i mean i trained my first training was with alex howard and the optimal health clinic and their therapeutic coaching training and actually even before that i train in some body work and doing the bowen technique so i actually started out i was a body work practitioner and then in time i ended up connecting to ashok gupta and i made the louis training program and ended up being a coach for the gut program which i have been for since two thousand and eight so really long time and yeah so that's kind of been a lot of my work actually has been a coach the gupta program more recent years i've trained in internal family systems ifs work which is about working with inner parts so i also work with people with ifs as well not necessarily through the gut program but just people with that model as well therapeutic model yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: wow what a wealth of information and knowledge and insight you are from all of this it's just incredible you know over the years the many years that you've now been doing this and working with people has your understanding of these conditions or recovery changed do you see a lot of variety in people's path to recovery and what are some of the biggest takeaways from the work that you've done\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah lots of different things but the power of recognizing the mind body connection and starting to understand that and do the work around that one piece that's perhaps a bit unique about what i bring is that looking back i feel a lot of my trauma wasn't necessarily personal but was ancestral was kind of more that i sort of took on from my family line so that that's a piece sometimes i see in clients that perhaps isn't spoken about so much that sometimes and particularly people are like oh not much happened to me but then you find out their mother's ill and their grandmother was ill or something like that what's going on in that family line that's created this pattern of illness for example\n\nSPEAKER_00: so yeah i also trained in family consolations work and that you know that's all about kind of how it affected by our wider family system and how an illness in one person might not be the root of that problem might actually be a more systemic or kind of wider family system issue so yeah that's an interesting\n\nSPEAKER_01: perspective it's fascinating i remember recently in animals and they can trace back if they have let's say a dog mother that has trauma they will see health problems in her children up to three generations after that from that and this is you know a study with dogs so i can even imagine how this all i'm sure i'm oversimplifying what you're saying here but just yeah of our families\n\nSPEAKER_01: so many things that we don't understand fully about what impacts our health and our world it's really fascinating yeah francis so

that there is a way out many people have recovered from this and are now thriving hi everyone i'm raylan if you're new here welcome on this channel we share insights knowledge and resources that we have learned to be helpful with conditions like mecfs and long covid so how do we know these things we've learned it from the more than a hundred and fifty recorded recovery interviews right here on the channel i'm excited to have frances goodall with us today all the way over in sheffield in the uk francis has an incredible story of overcoming mecfs and has used her knowledge to help others to also return to living fully like she does today as a working mom and an outdoor enthusiast who has even completed three half marathons so let's dive right in and welcome francis francis so amazing to have you here thank you for doing this today oh thank you for having me on your wonderful channel so take us back what was happening around the time when you first became unwell\n\nSPEAKER_00: so when i first became unwell i was quite young i was only nineteen i was at university and i was doing all of the things you know i had a job i was studying hard i joined all the different societies i possibly could join and you know developed a new friendship group and was going out a lot and then suddenly one day i was on my way to do some voluntary work and i just yeah just didn't feel well at all didn't know what was going on felt a bit fluy felt a bit strange felt a bit scared because it felt really weird and then yeah that was the start of it really i ended up not being able to continue my university studies ended up having to come back home and live with my mom and i think it probably took about six i think it took six months to get a chronic fatigue or me diagnosis\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah you can tell when someone went through this a while ago you know it wasn't last year the year before because i feel like we developed this ability to just zoom through that one of the most intense experiences of our life like yeah so i became unwell and then i had to drop on a university\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know that had to be a really scary thing at such a young age you know when you got started not feeling well and didn't get better what were you thinking\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i was well i also got i had a doctor wanted to diagnose me as being depressed not being the main issue as well like very early on but i knew it wasn't just depression i knew there was emotion about feeling unwell and you know i was emotionally challenged by that was probably getting depressed by that but i knew there was something else going on so yeah it was really scary time definitely a time that i feel like i've grieved and worked with as i healed you know at the other end which is probably why i can talk about it so lightly now but yeah at the time it was really really scary and i didn't know what was happening i didn't know what to do yeah and at first i kind of gave up it i went home and was kind of even doing things like watching daytime television and just feeling a bit low and you know all my friends from home had gone to university all my friends from university were still at university so initially i didn't really have anyone there other than my family and yeah it was a very tough time\n\nSPEAKER_01: so doctors told you that the cause of all this was depression\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah one of the first doctors said she just thought i was depressed that was it\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i think a lot of us hear that and it's i think a little bit infuriating i can see how they come to that conclusion because we likely are depressed but that wasn't for most of us the first thing takeaway pitch that was ability to function in the world and anyone's going to be depressed yeah so what did you do did you just start googling or how did you start to try and figure your way out of this\n\nSPEAKER_00: in the year before i got ill i had also traveled the world before going to university and i had got really interested in meditation and buddhism and yoga a little bit as well so i thought i did think quite early on well perhaps meditation and yoga can help me heal so i did start quite early on doing a little bit of meditation yoga a little bit of breath work like for instance i remember one time doing the alternate nostril breathing and noticing i felt different after doing it so or doing a relaxation oh yeah i often listen to relaxations as well guided relaxations and then doing them sometimes i'd notice i felt considerably better after doing one so that those sorts of experiences quite early on gave me some hope that there was something i could do about getting myself better but often it was just like feeling better for a little bit and then i'd feel much worse again you know so it took a long time to learn to really get a deeper shift or to yeah well took five years to get fully well but it was a very up and down journey as well yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i imagine you tried some things over those years that didn't work what were some of those things\n\nSPEAKER_00: well for example quite early on i remember going to an acupuncturist who had written an article that said me and my me chronic fatigue recovery cure and i was like oh this is going to be the thing that's going to cure me so i had some acupuncture and she gave me some herbs as well which just tasted so bad and no it's not like against acupuncture because i love it and over the years it has been good since then and it did help it did help on some ways on my journey but that particular acupuncture or series of sessions didn't seem to do anything for me at that point but maybe it just wasn't the right thing at that point you know but later on i do think acupuncture did help a little bit i'm not quite anything against chinese medicine or acupuncture but it was yeah that didn't didn't particularly do anything in those early stages i'm trying to remember i mean i would at some point i started like trying one therapy after another you know i'd go for reiki and i'd go for this and i go for that and you know try different kinds of alternative therapies i went to a nutritional therapist she did colonic irrigation but i didn't even know apparently i brought in chronic irrigation but she gave me some nutrition advice and i do think i did have a you know like a candida issue as well so that perhaps was somewhat helpful to learn a bit about the body and things like candida imbalances and things like that but at the same time it wasn't that helpful i don't think yeah i don't know that makes sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: irrigation was that like colon hydrotherapy\n\nSPEAKER_00: they put water up you and like flush out your system yeah i've never had it done i didn't go for it but it was so in a way it was kind of funny that i hadn't even booked in for this session but i didn't think i had i thought i'd booked in to see a nutritional therapist again because my dad had told me that she'd helped cure someone of chronic fatigue you know so it was like following these different things these different lines of possibility for hope and a cure\n\nSPEAKER_01: i ended up doing colon hydrotherapy as one of the zillion things i tried to get well and did you keep watching if you've never tried it you haven't lived experience fully i think funny though i ended up meeting one of my best friends ever she was my colon hydrotherapist i think you just bond really quickly like you get past all the small talk once you're anyways it's the stuff that we all tried well it's just it's yeah that level of desperation\n\nSPEAKER_00: as well before even all this you know cold therapy that it's about these days but back then i remember reading an article about how cold can help me and i'd lying cold baths and i did often feel better afterwards i mean over there lying in a cold bath trying to get myself well yeah it's quite funny\n\nSPEAKER_01: i know you think about it we're going through this incredible suffering we have all these scary symptoms and then we're getting hoses put up our bums and laying in breathing full bath tubs it's like as if the suffering isn't enough we just kind of just desperate like okay if it even works for one person i gotta try it it's amazing that everyone i talked to your mind just suddenly becomes very open\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah i would try one thing and then the next thing and the next thing and i even flew to america i mean i'm in the uk and i flew to the us to florida to work with a healer that apparently had healed quite a few people of chronic fatigue as well so yeah just like loads of things i was i was so desperate to be well and to figure out what was going on\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah okay so eventually you did start to find some things that did help so what did that look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah well actually well two years into the illness i was doing a lot of meditation and i had an experience of meditation of a lot of energy flowing through my body and then i felt amazing like i felt like something had shifted but actually i ended up in quite an unstable kind of up and down process for three more years after that but i did think i was cured after two years through this meditation experience which is a bit mad but i was a bit intense about my meditation practice and i think i did have a kind of a release of energy but it was just not sustainable and yeah i still had a lot of things to figure out in myself but the things like towards the end of the recovery journey i read a book on reverse therapy and nickel therapy they were two practitioners i think that around the time they were working together at one point around reverse therapy and then they split off and did their own thing but i think i read both of their books and yeah something in that was like a bit of a light bulb for me about one of the key things i realized in myself was i had a massive pattern of like avoiding conflict at all costs like i could not possibly share something that might upset somebody else so i would just shut down and i think recognizing that pattern was one of the key parts for me to be able to get better and to sustain my health and i also didn't realize but i had quite a bit of suppressed anger and unresolved trauma in my system that i didn't realize was there\n\nSPEAKER_00: kind of started to come through in the various workshops and therapy sessions and coaching sessions i had during the five years to try and heal\n\nSPEAKER_01: okay so you mentioned two things there reverse therapy and mcale therapy so the first one reverse therapy what does that look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah they're very similar i can't remember the exact difference but it was about looking at symptoms and getting curious about symptoms and what is there an emotion underlying this symptom that's what i remember from it and starting to like really check in with myself and you know try and be more in tune with what was actually going on for me emotionally and yeah so that was a massive part i mean looking back i do think and all the research i've done around trauma i do think a lot of it for me was the impact of trauma on my system manifesting physically like a freeze response i don't know if you thought your perspective on that kind of stuff is but because even after i got better sometimes i'd go a little bit like a bit fatigue again and then i'd have to kind of work on something and then i'd feel back to normal again so it was yeah for me a lot of it when i look back i think was what's to do with the freeze response in my nervous system\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it's definitely a theme i couldn't begin to count how many people who have said something similar in their interview about that being a key piece of their recovery and it seems to be a core component of many recovery approaches like dr john sarno we hear a lot about his tms approach and lots of that theme of it's so mind blowing to me this is i think one of the most fascinating topics to me is how much those repressed emotions and that unresolved trauma can impact our nervous system and our brain and create all these symptoms and how much so many of us don't realize in our modern day society that we're walking around feeling like we are suppressing these things these feelings of anger and rage like i don't know i need to be a certain kind of person as a woman or a mother or a father or i need to be okay with working seventy hours a week or you know i have shame around this or it's not okay to feel this way or it's not okay to express my emotions and just by tampering all that down for all these years you know our system starts to recognize those feelings as scary and bad and it's fascinating how the body creates all these symptoms as a new distraction or is it because it's being hypersensitive or whatever the different theories are just understanding that and bringing that into light very impact for a lot of people yes\n\nSPEAKER_00: i mean i have one really strong example where i started to really understand the mind body connection you know i was with a group of people we were doing we were actually doing reiki on each other like a reiki share my boyfriend was there i was making tea for everyone my boyfriend was getting triggered because he thought i was going to tire myself out by doing too much and that he was going to have to pick up the pieces afterwards and then i was getting angry with him because you know because i felt like he wasn't trusting me and but i think it was just triggering some old stuff as well and then like i couldn't handle the anger so i remember just being like can't feel this i don't know what to do with it so just shut it down but then i could hardly walk and then i had to just lie down on the sofa and then he said something again that triggered me again and i just ran upstairs he said oh see i told you this is going to happen and i was like not because of that it's because i've done what to do with it yeah one moment the next moment i could run up the stairs i was like okay yeah this is really odd yeah what\n\nSPEAKER_01: did that look like for you starting to understand this mind body connection so what does that mean for starting to feel better and come out of this what does that look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah well i think a lot of it looked like learning to be more myself more authentic you know learning to express myself more authentically i remember learning non violent communication so i felt like when i had a bit of a way that i could communicate my feelings without it also being too much for someone else which i think initially because i had been so suppressed things would come out quite strongly at first you know like i remember alex howard i trained with him in coaching and he was talking about the pendulum that can swing from being you know very repressed to then the other way or a pendulum can swing from being one way to the other way and it's almost like coming back into balance again so i did notice that it was almost like i went from being so suppressed to then quite reactive and then had to learn how to be able to be authentic with people communicate my needs my feelings you know it's okay to have needs you know all these kind of things and but also to do things like continue to look after myself and you know prioritize time in nature prioritize time with friends prioritize self care as well as you know once i was better start developing my work and stepping into the world of work again after a long time of not being in the world of work but doing it in a way that was you know trying to be as balanced as possible and not too yeah not too out of balance yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's so interesting that so many of us go on this journey let's call it i mean it is a journey but can be very tough tough tough experience becoming so unwell and for many people last years it ends up being this teacher about how to like you said be more authentic take better care of yourself it is an amazing teacher and you know most people do come out the other side of it so much happier and more content and at peace and better equipped to deal with their life and their emotions and their health and the world it's it's fascinating i don't think most of us if you told us that coming into it we probably think you were crazy because it sounds even after doing all these interviews and i know it's true i know this is the case for so many people it's still every time i hear it my head kind of explodes you know yeah you're so sick it was like you need to lead a more authentic life yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: it definitely wouldn't have made sense when i first started to get sick but looking back i can be in a way i can be grateful for how much i learned through that journey of you know getting sick and figuring out how to be well again yeah how much so much learning so you've\n\nSPEAKER_01: talked about before or we talked about before this call preparing for this but you know the spiritual elements of your healing journey so can you talk a little bit about that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i don't know if you've had an old channel who shared anything like this i have had the odd client that's come to me with this but i also had a kundalini or spiritual some kind of spiritual awakening during my healing journey which is i think why the ups and downs were so intense i think i also there was also kind of trauma element of it like dissociation like coming out of my body definitely was part of the condition for me and part of what i had to work with afterwards was to learn really how to be in my body and i think spiritually i found something like meditation where i could have these really beautiful experiences sometimes i felt like i left my body and i was like connecting with the whole universe and you know it felt really amazing but then i but then i was really struggling to function in my life and my health was still all over the place you know sometimes i'd feel well and other times i crash again things like that so the spiritual element was an important element of my journey and yeah it's hard to describe it but i have also witnessed some other people who have also had that experience so it's kind of yeah happy to talk a little bit about that element of my journey yeah and i got deeply into meditation you know was reading so many books about buddhism and meditation and sometimes i was meditating at times when i was sick three hours a day and i actually got to the point where i had to stop meditating for a while because i was kind of using it in the wrong way i was using it to sort of escape everyday reality and have these mystical experiences but then actually finding it harder to function in everyday reality so i had to sort of yeah learn to do normal things for a while and connect with nature and you know be able to have a normal conversation i think after like a five year healing journey and then all the spiritual experience as well it was it was like yeah i just found normal life a challenge to integrate back into that makes sense that's a really\n\nSPEAKER_01: good point yeah because then once you're well and feeling better the rat race the world is waiting for you and\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that haven't been through what you've been through especially at such a young age i imagine just emotionally matured much more rapidly than most of us do at that time period in our lives probably challenging to you know connect or just see where this how this all fits together yeah sounds like this\n\nSPEAKER_01: changed you a lot clearly this whole experience has changed you a lot what has life been like since you've been well\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i mean life has been good overall i mean overall i feel like i've learned how to have experience a lot of joy a lot of inner peace you know i have a great community yeah i've had a child i've got a son who's ten yeah and life's been rich and great and i've you know done lots of different kinds of therapeutic and coaching trainings and been working in this field myself nearly twenty years so yeah there's been lots of great things i've run half marathons i think i did what partly want to prove like to the world of myself i am fully well you know yeah so yeah life's been life's been good and i feel like i've definitely learned so much through that time that shifted things for a deep level for me and also kept me interested in personal growth you know because i was like well how you know doing some emotional work and spiritual work and heal chronic fatigue and where else can i go with this you know how much joy can i create in this lifetime how much ease can i create and yeah so i do keep up quite a few of the practices that support me to heal and new practices you know always learning new things and do feel like i'm a lifelong learner as well i'm always fascinated by learning new things\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i was listening to you talk like how do i have more you in my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: this is i'm so inspired by how this has changed you and just the spiritual development and yeah that continuous growth i'm curious because a lot of us think of recovery from these conditions like there's a finish line where that chapter ends and then the rest of your life starts yeah but in reality a lot of people find it's more of an ongoing journey so what's that been like for you is there self care things you need to still do you know is there any part of you that's worried about you know becoming unwell again what's life kind of post recovery been for you\n\nSPEAKER_00: i mean it has been a really long time now so yeah it's been maybe seventeen years since i'd say the five years was up but in those years you know especially in the lesser in recent years but definitely sort of my later twenties early thirties i did have periodically sort of what i would now describe even back then i didn't always understand it would be like trauma type symptoms would come up like i'd feel a bit shut down or a bit dissociated and i wouldn't know why and then i'd have to go and do some work on myself with a practitioner or perhaps i'd go and spend some nighttime in nature and that would regulate me but i did have to quite yeah quite regularly kind of figure out how to regulate myself again when things were out of balance and that can still happen today but not to the extent it was still happening in my sort of late twenties early thirties and not as often so yeah but that was when i yeah i guess sort of started to see that it wasn't all about being chronically sick and definitely wasn't about being chronic sick anymore like i don't worry about that and i didn't worry about that i mean maybe a little bit in the early stages because i was a bit kind of like oh i've been ill for all these years now i need to make up for it i need to go and help at these retreats that i used to go and just receive i need to go and do all these things and i need to get this message of healing out into the world and you know and there was a bit of a kind of pushy energy and all of that sometimes but overall no i never worry about getting chronically sick again with chronic fatigue yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah amazing clearly this also shifted or influenced your career trajectory so you tell us a bit about that\n\nSPEAKER_00: well yeah yeah so i mean i trained my first training was with alex howard and the optimal health clinic and their therapeutic coaching training and actually even before that i train in some body work and doing the bowen technique so i actually started out i was a body work practitioner and then in time i ended up connecting to ashok gupta and i made the louis training program and ended up being a coach for the gut program which i have been for since two thousand and eight so really long time and yeah so that's kind of been a lot of my work actually has been a coach the gupta program more recent years i've trained in internal family systems ifs work which is about working with inner parts so i also work with people with ifs as well not necessarily through the gut program but just people with that model as well therapeutic model yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: wow what a wealth of information and knowledge and insight you are from all of this it's just incredible you know over the years the many years that you've now been doing this and working with people has your understanding of these conditions or recovery changed do you see a lot of variety in people's path to recovery and what are some of the biggest takeaways from the work that you've done\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah lots of different things but the power of recognizing the mind body connection and starting to understand that and do the work around that one piece that's perhaps a bit unique about what i bring is that looking back i feel a lot of my trauma wasn't necessarily personal but was ancestral was kind of more that i sort of took on from my family line so that that's a piece sometimes i see in clients that perhaps isn't spoken about so much that sometimes and particularly people are like oh not much happened to me but then you find out their mother's ill and their grandmother was ill or something like that what's going on in that family line that's created this pattern of illness for example\n\nSPEAKER_00: so yeah i also trained in family consolations work and that you know that's all about kind of how it affected by our wider family system and how an illness in one person might not be the root of that problem might actually be a more systemic or kind of wider family system issue so yeah that's an interesting\n\nSPEAKER_01: perspective it's fascinating i remember recently in animals and they can trace back if they have let's say a dog mother that has trauma they will see health problems in her children up to three generations after that from that and this is you know a study with dogs so i can even imagine how this all i'm sure i'm oversimplifying what you're saying here but just yeah of our families\n\nSPEAKER_01: so many things that we don't understand fully about what impacts our health and our world it's really fascinating yeah francis so

so we're both in california which made scheduling this incredibly easy so grateful that she's joining me here today to talk to all of you here on my channel about her journey with any cfs she was unwell with any cfs for thirteen years before finally fully recovering so she's got a lot of really great stuff to share so i'm really excited about this thank you so much rebecca for taking the time to do\n\nSPEAKER_00: oh it's such a pleasure ray lynn i've watched your channel recently and i'm just so touched by the heart you put into it it's really clear that you're just here to support people and just offer all the different ways that helped you and helped others recover so i'm happy to share my story\n\nSPEAKER_01: i appreciate you saying that yeah it's really it's all the people like yourself put in time and effort and courage to talk about their story publicly like this\n\nSPEAKER_01: thank you very much yeah you were here to talk about your health journey so let's get into it can take us back to this all begin yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: well before the symptoms started i was in my early thirties i was tv news reporter so i had like a very busy high powered stressful job but when i really enjoyed i did a lot of international travel i socialized a lot so i was busy i exercised it kind of did all the things that you think of doing in your early thirties and\n\nSPEAKER_00: i actually went on a trip to asia just for leisure but i ended up having a really traumatic experience when i was over there i was sexually assaulted and that led to a really grueling urinary tract infection that i got on a seventeen hour plane trip back and my whole system just kind of blacked out i actually sort of lost consciousness on the plane it was really an awful experience and when i got back to the states i was just really exhausted but i was still able to work and i still kind of pushed through things and i went to a few doctors i really sort of blocked out the trauma and i wasn't able to process that on a conscious emotional level and then strangely the next year around the same time of year it was like late fall i went back to asia and i was questioning the trip because i wasn't feeling that well that time i got these three colds kind of like back to back one was when i was there in china one was on the plane trip back and then one was once i returned back to san diego and then my system completely crashed after that i just went totally kaput i felt like i had the flu twenty four seven i had a lot of the quintessential me c f s symptoms i couldn't sleep at all overnight which was really the insomnia was a grueling one for me i was so exhausted for a number of weeks and even months i would say that i could hardly just walk around the house the brain fog was really bad i felt like i couldn't remember the name of you know a good friend or a colleague digestive issues i also started getting hot flashes and kind of like pre menopausal symptoms even though i was so young so that's kind of how all it began in a nutshell\n\nSPEAKER_01: so what did you think when all this started happening\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know i was so scared ray lynn i was just really i'm sure like you and so many people can relate i was just terrified because although i had had some fatigue it started really coming on very suddenly after those viruses\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i didn't in any way think about the trauma that had happened to me or actually a previous similar assault that happened when i was nineteen none of that was in my awareness i really was just wanting to get well so i did use whatever strength i have to start researching and going to doctors and basically my mom was driving me around because i couldn't really drive or do anything i was really lucky that i lived in the same town as my parents and i sort of just started urgently going to doctors everything from allopathic medicine to natural path medicine to integrative medicine at that point to some specialists and they did diagnose me with any c f s which at that time was largely called chronic fatigue syndrome more than the me post viral syndrome some of them would say there was some fibromyalgia in there because of all the body pain although that also can be very typical with with c f s\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i think i remember thinking on the one hand i was relieved to have a diagnosis because i suddenly couldn't go to work i had to just tell my boss well you know i used to be someone who would work like sixty hours a week and i just i can't go to work anymore so it sort of helped me in that way but on the other hand it was really devastating because i remember particularly a natural path a doctor who i had so much faith in and i thought well he's you know he's natural he's going to help me recover in a really gentle way and he specialized in this diagnosis and he actually said like we we don't know what the causes and we there is no cure and really you're going to have to live with this i mean that's all i can tell you and i just remember bawling you know being so devastated and really feeling like this was just this death sentence but in a way a life sentence that i was given that i would have to live with for years\n\nSPEAKER_01: when you got this diagnosis\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think so i mean it wasn't something that i didn't know anyone that had c f s maybe distantly i had heard of it but i really didn't know much about it and of course the diagnosis chronic fatigue syndrome sounds like you're just you just need a nap but my life was like feeling like i had the flu twenty four seven and i couldn't even sleep that was really hard because i never got any relief from the symptoms i would usually sleep like a couple hours a night but no it was really new to me and i you know i had been a reporter so i started researching as much as i could and seen as many doctors as i could over really what became the next thirteen years\n\nSPEAKER_01: initial times to any of these doctors or practitioners that you were seeing recommend any sort of treatment\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah there there were all kinds of things i mean like you i think i was on tons of supplements i was on probably forty or fifty different supplements at one time and i had all my little baggies and pillboxes lined up i didn't really ever see a change with that i went to dio a doctor of osteopathy who also practiced homeopathy and she put me on the anti candida diet so actually for years i wasn't even eating you know carrots or any grains or anything like that which really wasn't a diet that i liked i had been mainly plant based before but i was willing to do whatever and those things weren't making a difference so then i started really going to more specialists neurologists endocrinologist rheumatologists the rheumatologist actually suggested antiviral intervenious drugs and i had been a bit more natural but of course i was willing to try anything so i really thought this was going to work and my entire system crashed i ended up back in bed for months after those medications\n\nSPEAKER_00: i had done a lot of iv vitamins i got really into our your veda and i do think that kind of helped me live a little more healthy balanced life and start moving back into more plant foods but it didn't shift the symptoms i went to all kinds of energy healers and i actually did see a little relief with some of the energy healers but it would just be very short lived and i would kind of go back to my baseline oh gosh i went to even sleep psych their sleep psychologists their sleep doctors by the way there's every kind of sleep expert and that was still a really vexing symptom when i wouldn't sleep the symptoms would be a lot worse the next day and eventually i started going to see some psychologists because i was starting to connect\n\nSPEAKER_00: there was a lot of psychological you know trauma and grief that happened before the onset of these symptoms and in these years i should say not to sound like this is such a sob story but i know you really place a value on just being honest with our stories there was a lot of personal griefs my father was very ill and eventually passed away about five years into my illness my mother almost died and they were like my rocks i was single engagement had broken up because it was just so hard to sustain you know he didn't he couldn't really understand why i couldn't do anything anymore i was about to lose my house i had lost the career i really loved so it was just there was a lot going on and now what what i know in how i healed i see how all those emotional stressors were really activating my brain and nervous system and making the symptoms worse i didn't really make those connections at the time but i do think some psychotherapy was helpful just to kind of talk through some of these some of these griefs that were going on\n\nSPEAKER_01: a lot of heavy hard things you're hit with i'm so sorry that you have to go through all of that how did this impact you know emotionally psychologically people understandably start feeling severe depression what was\n\nSPEAKER_00: thank you for acknowledging that i think those of us who go through this need to be acknowledged and a lot of times are really not in the health care system we're just sort of this body that is trying to get better but at times i fell into some depression i'm lucky in that i never say deep into a depression and i never really actively thought about taking my life but i remember just years where i felt like what's the point of living at all i mean on doing is taking these supplements like eating foods i don't even like for what i have no purpose anymore it was really hard to socialize too because when i would it would activate symptoms so i wasn't doing a whole lot of that other than a couple close friends and family that would come visit so it did take its toll i think though for the most part i was able to kind of keep some just some hope and some optimism although doctors were saying we don't have a cure there was something in me that was like but this isn't me like this isn't my life this is not how it's going to go i know that there's something that can get well there's something in me even that is well and that can heal on this physical level and i was always a somewhat spiritual person but i started meditating and really practicing yoga and i think that sense of spiritual connection to something that was greater than myself really helped i think it helped with my emotions and helped just feel like there was some hope and there was there was some kind of broader picture than i was able to see right now you\n\nSPEAKER_01: made a lot of changes a lot of big changes like in your lifestyle and your diet and i think a lot of us do that or asked to do that right off the start i'm just curious how you found that you know when i first got my diagnosis i was told you know more sugar gluten nor alcohol no more i mean i was drinking at the time but sugar and the gluten were still very much in my life and i had a raging sugar addiction and then i was just sent home and just like make all these changes live off of ko and it was really tough for me and then a lot of self you know because i was sticking to this plan all the time it was supposed to help so what was the process like for you making all of these changes oh my\n\nSPEAKER_00: gosh i can relate to all of that you know it was like not only are you totally miserable but we're going to take away anything you enjoy eating which is like one of the few kind of pleasures left so i was also on you know the gluten free dairy free sugar free i also i couldn't drink any caffeine or alcohol if i would just have a sip i would be shot for days even more so\n\nSPEAKER_00: i was on the elimination diet so there was just basically i was eating like protein usually either chicken or fish and cooked vegetables because i would get really bloated if i would have salad so yeah it was it was kind of miserable i mean it just sort of felt like this deprivation and i think too in looking back there was a part of me that really resented it because i didn't feel like i was an active participant at that point in my own healing you know really felt like i went to sort of more natural pathogen doctors because i thought there is going to be more inclusionary but in a lot of ways it was still like ok there take this medication take this supplement take this herb do this diet and i just sort of felt like it was being done to me and actually i did have a really perceptive doctor years later i saw for the c f s and although he didn't really help me with the symptoms he helped me emotionally because actually he said you know what i think you think i'm going to tell you to take a bunch more supplements and more restrictive diets and i suspect that's actually perpetuating the trauma in which you felt you were in control of your body and now you're just being told what to do with your body by all these medical professionals and rayland i just started crying i was like someone sees me and i didn't even know that's how i felt but i think for those of us even if there isn't a trauma what i find with other people i meet who have c f s is often if not always there's a lot of stress beforehand and there can be a sense then whether it was existent before or certainly after the diagnosis of just being so powerless and so i started realizing with diet and everything else at some point i have to regain my agency and my power and my collaboration in my healing because otherwise i was resenting it and i and i just i think those diets didn't work partly because of that and partly because the root cause of my c f s was not that i wasn't eating enough kale right that wasn't the cause or that i wasn't taking thirty supplements a day\n\nSPEAKER_01: such a good point one of the things that i just love about these interviews is that i learned something about my own journey and i get more insight every single person i talk to hadn't really thought about you know and i make when i made the switch later on in my journey to plant based it was so easy i did it effortlessly but it was my choice and i had just it was my idea and i believed in it so in the beginning when those were imposed on me it was really challenging and i found even though i was thought i was committed i was forever trying to find work around like ok i can't have gluten i can't have sugar i really want some chicken fingers so i took some chicken and cornflakes and i deep fry them and then i think the sauce made out of like stevia\n\nSPEAKER_01: or you know like not healthy food at all but there was no sugar\n\nSPEAKER_01: right make all these desserts that were like raisins and somehow maple syrup and like why didn't sugar in there so i like diet sodas like diet orange soda so i get\n\nSPEAKER_01: myself up in the beginning with so much crap trying to like find me like ok\n\nSPEAKER_00: absolutely and especially i remember watching a video where you were talking about you know for me i just feel better on plant based diets and that's what i found too and so i think especially if you're being asked to eat in a way that just doesn't feel right to your body for whatever reason not that there is one right or wrong diet but for you there's going to be resentment you're right you're going to try to find ways around it that are necessarily nutritional\n\nSPEAKER_01: so what happened what\n\nSPEAKER_00: so let's see i think that you know this whole thirteen year saga had different phases and and i would say the first five years i was really impaired meaning i couldn't do much out of the house i mean i could still take care of myself which was really nice but my parents would bring groceries and things\n\nSPEAKER_00: then i would say like the next maybe five or six years i had a little more ability and mobility and i could do things like i could go to a local yoga studio and i would notice when i would do things that i would enjoy especially that was really calming and soothing i would get a little more energy so i mean i was doing like a lot of restorative yoga but still i was getting out i could see friends a little bit more but like not in the evenings if i saw a friend in the evening i have insomnia i wouldn't sleep all night\n\nSPEAKER_00: so but what i really noticed over time was kind of back to this point of personal agency and starting to like tune into really what works for me was i noticed when i would be in nature which i really loved when i would read poetry or i love listening to eckhart tolle i actually couldn't read a lot that was the thing because of the brain fog i could only really read people like eckhart tolle because he writes a few words and it means so much or i could read poetry because it was just a few words right but i started really getting into that i started writing poetry i started actually just more doing what gave me a little bit of peace or relief rather than just trying to fix myself and get rid of the symptoms wasn't that i totally gave up on it but i would say i mean this took well over a decade to kind of like get off the roller coaster because i just noticed again and again i was so exasperated by trying every last diet every supplement every i mean i one point i was doing like enemas every single night all these rituals deep detoxes ten days worth and i was just like none of these things have worked and so i just kind of started tuning into my own self and my own body and then i had this one experience which actually ended up being a blessing where i thought oh i'll try one more healer so this woman was supposedly a shamanic healer she was like a white woman in san diego who had done a little bit of training in the amazon and so she i went in for a session with her and she was kind of smoking her pipe and she asked me about the trauma and i actually started opening up for some reason and really crying and she changed the subject and said you know i don't think we should talk about this let's talk about my cat which i'm dressing up for halloween and so i think somehow she got triggered or something but i felt so shut down and so numb after that and i wrote her out a two hundred dollars check i left there numb and i was just like i am never going to give away my power to someone else like here i'm thinking this woman who's not even listening to me who's shutting me down is going to heal me and it's just not going to happen not to say i didn't think i needed help from people or that we don't need support but it shifted kind of the power dynamic because the situation with her was so ridiculous you know that i was paying her two hundred dollars to tell me about her cat costume now about twelve years in something happened i was actually meditating a lot i got me into transcendental meditation and kind of the inner teachings of yoga which really teach us that everything on the outside including our health comes from our internal state at least there's some origin with you know our minds and so i was just fascinated with all these philosophies and studies practices and it lit me up and i felt like i got to this point where some kind of surrender happened and i know that sounds really cliche but it's hard to describe i fell into this state of peace there was actually mental peace even though i still had the same symptoms and i kind of was almost observing myself there would be intense flu like you know aching but i felt it in my body but i was kind of watching it and there was this internal state of nonresistance or peace and it really wasn't something i tried to do although i had been studying about it but it kind of happened and interestingly that went on for a year i mean so it didn't actually shift the physical symptoms but i sort of was it's not like i wanted them to be there i mean this was this whole situation sucked it was treacherous it was a grueling but at that point somehow i wasn't fighting it and so i feel like from that place i really wasn't pursuing medical interventions i was eating what i wanted which which is like mostly plant based organic whole foods i just like that you know it felt good to my body it was kind of like intuition nutrition i would i couldn't work i was on disability and there was that bothered me i mean i wanted a purpose i wanted to contribute but i just kind of accepted this is where i am right now and so from that place interestingly as i started just like pursuing what i enjoyed i took this online writing class called right into light and i met this woman and she said oh i recovered from c f s through this type of mind body work if you want we can set up a phone conversation and i also got migraine so i was like well i can only talk on the phone for ten minutes but yeah i would love to do that\n\nSPEAKER_00: so we set up this conversation we start talking and she starts telling me all her symptoms were exactly the same you know and she had epstein bar and she had all these things and that she made this total recovery well i told her i could talk for ten minutes three hours later i actually got up and ran around the block like i had not ran in thirteen years i had something of like a mini spontaneous remission now this was not the end of the story you know symptoms did come back so i don't want people to think oh that doesn't happen to me it can't happen but what that conversation showed me was that i could recover and what really changed for me was she explained that all these years doctors had been saying these viruses were suppressing my immune system so it was like the epstein bar and ten other viruses that i just couldn't overcome and so to me i felt like that's this insurmountable physical thing but she explained she had all those diagnoses she had all those viral titers and what happened was she learned that it was more how her brain and nervous system were processing stress and just stuck in this hyper vigilant mode and essentially her brain had learned these patterns these neuropathways and she recovered and at the end of this conversation now you would think this would be infuriating but by this point i was so with her she said rebecca you're not sick you know and i think she kind of alluded you're just you're stressed you've been through trauma your system stuck in this pattern but you can get out of it and i believed it i believed it one hundred percent like i felt it in all of me and my body reacted with that that burst of energy at least in that moment\n\nSPEAKER_01: wow so in that conversation it wasn't even as if you were doing some sort of you know therapy or work on yourself it was just this breakthrough of understanding of what was happening and it gave you this break from symptoms at least for a little bit exactly\n\nSPEAKER_00: exactly and that's a really good point because i think for me what the key was even though this woman wasn't a therapist she wasn't a doctor she and i had been a science journalist so i love science and she kind of explained the science of what can happen in our brain and nervous system with chronic fatigue chronic pain brain fog with all these symptoms and it made sense to me and so i felt like she was literally rediagnosing me which is crazy because she's not a medical professional but i felt like i can overcome this because it's now a matter of understanding this knowledge learning how i can calm down my nervous system start feeling my emotions start challenging myself more like getting back to more activities to sort of retrain my brain and it was kind of like to me and i'm not saying this is for everybody but for me i felt like i finally heard the truth like this resonated with me with what was happening and it gave me hope that i could recover instead of just being like viruses or faulty genes or mitochondria or things i couldn't do anything about\n\nSPEAKER_00: and after i had that little spontaneous remission i ran around the block multiple times i knew i was on the right path i knew beyond a shadow of a doubt and that's all it was was knowledge i mean it was just information which is really crazy and i think it was her caring like she cared a lot to help me she spent three hours on the phone with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: absolutely incredible and it just it makes me question so many things about my own experience in my own story and you're talking about food and for years i couldn't eat rice it made me incredibly sick it was one of my food intolerances and even after i recovered i still have some rice feel sick i was terrified of rice and i lived in asia for eight and a half years so that was a challenging situation but just recently i just started trying having little tiny bits like oh i feel okay let's try to have a little bit more oh i feel okay and now i can eat copious amounts and i'm fine and i just assumed okay my body must have healed it but now i'm thinking you know it might have just been a brain association all those years that i had built up triggering that response and then as i built that confidence with like a little bit i'm ok a little bit i'm okay brought up and socialized not to attribute attribute our physical symptoms to something that's being caused by the brain like we don't even see the connection at all like there's a wall here where this stuff starts where this stuff starts and it's just exactly to see that that's\n\nSPEAKER_00: not the case so fascinating well exactly and you know what's so interesting we're raised like you say to see like a physical symptom has to have a physical cause but now there's actually a whole body of neuroscience and scientific research showing that there's just two studies out this year one out of harvard and one out of boulder but the basically shows chronic pain is caused and cured by a form of brain retraining by this specific approach because the brain generates pain and it generates pain as well as fatigue because it senses danger but that danger can be psychological as well as physical it's the same part of the brain that perceives it and so what's so ironic is that the doctor i ended up studying with to train in this howard schubiner who i highly recommend his book called unlearn your pain and he talks about fatigue he talks about these food sensitivities as well and he really helped me see it's like not necessarily that some food is bad for us or some behavior is that our brain perceives it so if you eat a poisonous berry the next time you see that berry you'll get queasy because your brain via your body is trained to protect you but you might see another berry like a blueberry and you could get queasy because that part of the brain the emotional limbic centers aren't like particularly discriminating they're just sort of picking up information in our environment and if we're stressed or in our nervous system hypervigilant they can mistake that like rice isn't good for me or whatever we're told by our doctors isn't good but this dr schupner actually led me to believe and it became true that i could eat all these foods it's just that my brain had become so scared of them so of course this is not true with an actual like food allergy like peanuts and things i mean that really does exist but with the sensitivities to food i know it kind of blows your mind and i'm not trying to say that people should just start eating all these things i mean you have to decide for yourself but what you're describing to me is interesting that it sounds very similar when you can kind of retrain yourself that you know it wasn't an innate food allergy it's an association or a condition response it's like pavlov's dog right it's the same dynamic\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah and i think thank you for taking the time to explain all that because i think that's an important distinction because i think a lot of us myself included sometimes get a bit put back or like are you saying just imagining this whole thing and it's not that it doesn't exist you know our brain is a very real part of our body it's another organ that we have so it is creating conditions in our body it is something that is real it's just not maybe caused by the organ that we think is causing it it's originating from a different place in the body\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i'm so glad you said that because i know like all of us who have dealt with cfs we've been told like you're making this up or we've been doubted so i so get that people are sensitive to this and these symptoms are a hundred percent real and the people who i've mentioned dr sarno and dr schubiner whose work really helped me they're very clear this is a hundred percent real but like you said the brain is like the master control so like we know the brain and the nervous system are constantly scanning for danger and if they sense it they'll go into flight fight or freeze mode to protect you so either to help you to run or fight and you're flooded with stress hormones or to shut you down if the danger seems too big i think with cfs the danger seems too big a lot of times and we become frozen and our brain and nervous system is trying to help us it's creating real physical symptoms they could not be more real\n\nSPEAKER_00: but in my case at least i came to believe that the things i was told were causing the symptoms were more like effects like the epstein bar i'm sure was higher because my brain and nervous system weren't functioning optimally and so when you're prepared to run or fight your digestion is not a priority your hormones aren't a priority all these other things are not working as well that's true the immune system isn't a priority but what i found for me is that wasn't the answer because that was the effect not the cause and the cause was like going to the brain but also like not to say this is caused by emotions because i know that can put people off and they can think oh i'm being told i'm just emotional or depressed it's not that at all but one thing i really feel is missing in the medical system is acknowledging we are living breathing feeling human beings and back to when darwin wrote about the evolutionary value of emotions emotions are actually what tells our brain and nervous system whether we're safe or not safe whether to trigger the flight fight freeze response right if there's fear that response the nerve firing patterns change\n\nSPEAKER_00: the hormones change to help us so emotions are the cue so to act like i just felt like doctors didn't ever ask once was there anything stressful possibly happening in your life before you went from being this active tv news reporter to being homebound no one asked that and it's like where's the heart and the humanity much less the neuroscience and i don't mean to blame or implicate i know everybody's doing their best but i think we need like more trauma informed care and even more understanding that the brain and the nervous system do react from fear in perpetuating symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_01: i find it really interesting you talked about the pain because there's so many people who are living with chronic pain and unfortunately with my experience i had some but it wasn't serious and i just i don't know how people function with that level of chronic pain in their life and then recently i reviewed the curable app because people kept telling me about it and through that process just learning about the app how it works reading reviews reaching out to people the mecfs community asking about their experience with it and a lot of people are having significant success or completely having their pain gone because of using this and it is coming from the premise that the chronic pain is originating in the brain so is that all part of like the process of your recovery is there something similar\n\nSPEAKER_00: such a great question i'm really glad to see curable and other things like that are kind of gaining more acceptance curable is based on this exact same approach so one of the doctors i mentioned howard schubiner is on the board of curable john sarno has passed away but he was kind of considered the early pioneer in this so curable is based on this and i actually discovered not the curable app but john sarno's work in this this whole mind body approach much earlier in my cfs journey but i discovered sarno's book healing back pain which by the way back pain neck pain all these chronic pains are also usually caused by the brain and nervous system rather than a structural issue but i couldn't see how to apply that to myself it was like but i have exhaustion i have brain fog i have all these other things and i think when i met that woman i'm ever grateful for kathy and she explained she used a very similar approach as curable and she just sort of used fatigue as a synonym and later i reached out to howard schubiner and\n\nSPEAKER_00: did a training with him and i asked him and he said it's the same thing because if you think of fatigue there's a part of you that doesn't feel safe and it's sort of like your system's trying to like shut you down and like keep you at home and it did feel like that for me like i think there was a perception this is subconscious by the way because ninety percent of our brain and emotions including our emotions are subconscious so we're not aware of them but i think that for me there was this perception like the world's not safe anymore after that assault and it was sort of like my system trying to keep me at home now it is a bit of a painful way to try to protect you but you know this we're dealing with also kind of some reptilian parts of the brain fear based parts of the brain but anyway to go to your point i haven't done the curable app because i already recovered through some of the other books and through coaching but it's it's really the same approach and people can apply it to brain fog and digestive issues and fatigue as well so\n\nSPEAKER_01: my body approach what would one day one week in your life look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: so do you mean like more when i was recovering or just today yet more when i was recovering ok so yeah both because i still i still integrate it but i would say when i was still over that first year i was every day doing these meditations called somatic tracking so i'm really glad curable i'm told by some of my clients now has somatic tracking meditations on there but basically you don't even need a meditation but it's helpful to be guided where you're just kind of tracking sensations in your body so it's like the fatigue might end up feeling like you know heaviness through your whole body or say i would have a lot of burning in my arm so i would bring my mind into that but you're getting these messages of safety like i'm safe and ok there's actually nothing wrong with my body so you're kind of retraining your brain and i would do that every day i would actually do it every night as well and i feel like it broke the insomnia habit and i say habit because that's also kind of a subconscious learned behavior that the bed becomes associated with anxiety so i would do the somatic tracking usually a few different meditations every day i would i just love reading the books there's different podcasts on this approach curable has one there's others that i really like called tell me about your pain is one of them so i was learning about it and then i would like go and start to do things i was like oh i'm going to go try to walk a half a mile or a mile or something at this point i would just walk a little more and i would notice the symptoms so as i'm doing it the symptoms are rising i'm getting that malaise and i would just be like reiterate like you know i'm ok i got this i i know what's going on and that's like how you retrain your brain that you can do these things which i think a lot of people do anyway through graded exposure you know honestly it doesn't take a lot of time this approach it's kind of just learning it doing the meditations i would see this coach once a week in the beginning then every other week and just started really adding on activities to my life including food i started eating more things that i wanted and at first like you do have a reaction because your brain thinks that's not good for you but then within usually a few times i could just eat it ok it's crazy i know it does sort of seem wild and i think that there has to be a certain pacing and timing with this because i'll say i was really ready i would have been able to just jump into this years before when for one i didn't really believe it and i was bed bound so i mean just to have like compassion for people i think that was another thing i really brought in raylan and again it's not that it took time but i started bringing in self compassion when i would get symptoms i would just ask how am i feeling emotionally because with this work you want to bring it back to the emotions because we so focus on the physical symptoms but you really want to tend to the emotions which are driving the state of the nervous system so it's like how am i feeling emotionally and i would acknowledge i'm scared i'm really scared i'm really frustrated and then i would just kind of be compassionate with myself and i still am to this day like that's really hard you know just talk to myself i'm so sorry what do you what do you want or need right now instead of just pushing myself i would challenge myself but if i needed to back down i would and sometimes take a break and just kind of tune into like what do you want or need it just has gotten to be and now over it's been a few years a much more kind of personal attentive way of dealing with yourself i mean it sounds funny to be talking to yourself but i think we all do anyway so it's just doing it in a much more compassionate way where i used to beat myself up like you had said for not recovering i was like i'm failing what's wrong with me you know and i mean that dr schumer and others will explain that self criticism actually does activate the danger alarm signal in the brain and the nervous system so it actually can feed into symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_00: and so yeah just being a lot more like compassionate with myself like this is really hard but we can do hard things and we'll pick it back up when when it's time\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i know you and i have talked about before\n\nSPEAKER_01: personality traits but some people at least\n\nSPEAKER_01: is kind of illnesses people who drive themselves hard people who are critical of themselves so do you think that plays a role in symptom perpetuation or impacts recovery in some way\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know when people read john sarno's books and there's one called the mind body prescription and he describes the personality type of people who get chronic symptoms and he does talk about c f s but he also talks about chronic pain and other symptoms that he believes had an origin in the brain and nervous system and he describes like perfectionist check right people pleasers check maybe you're doing things for other people instead of for yourself people who are like really conscientious hard driving\n\nSPEAKER_00: put a lot of pressure on themselves to do things well and i just felt like i was seeing myself in those pages and as i meet people with c f s and you meet so many people\n\nSPEAKER_00: i do see that pattern a lot like we're and also and not just that with myself with a lot of people i meet it's like not only are we putting all this pressure and stress and even sometimes criticism on ourselves but we're holding the emotions it so it becomes kind of like a pressure cooker right like if you have a water that's boiling with the lid on eventually it's going to burst because we're holding in all the pressures i remember i know i keep bringing him up but he's such a kind man and i think he's really very forward looking but dr schubiner in a training was saying people who get c f s and these chronic symptoms they're really nice people like i get to work with the nicest people right because it's not people who take out their stuff on other people but the flip side of that is like kind of holding in the emotions\n\nSPEAKER_00: part of that too i'll throw in i did some journaling like expressive writing to kind of like really just get out all the frustration i didn't mention that earlier in my practices but just to kind of like let myself really journal and write about anything that i'm too nice to say to anyone\n\nSPEAKER_00: that that was actually that was helpful and then yeah back to your point the personality traits i think just learning that you know we all kind of learn this with with any c f s like we can't be perfectionists right like some of us i mean i was lucky if i could just take a shower some days so it kind of softened and that was that was a good thing but then when i recovered and went back to work i did see some of those tendencies come back and i do actively work with it where i'll notice if i'm pushing too hard like if i'm feeling stressed or pressure like i got to gotta got to get these things done i can start getting a little fatigue and i can also start getting i recovered from interstitial cystitis through the same work the bladder pain i can get like little hints of it but i'm always able to link it to like emotional stress either that happened to me or that i put myself under\n\nSPEAKER_00: and once i'm aware of it usually the symptoms subside or sometimes i'll do like the somatic tracking meditation i mentioned to you or something like that but i think i softened you know i still i still have some of that you know i don't think we have to like totally change who we are to get well again but i found it was a wake up call to be more kind to myself and more authentic in who i always was where i think in many ways before i liked my life as a t v news reporter but in a lot of ways it wasn't really me i mean i do tend to like a quieter more introspective life i like to do more writing and i think a lot of times it's like more finding who you really are and who you really are in treating yourself like you would treat a good friend i think these things can actually help more than we know and they have helped me a lot and i feel with a lot of people that it can really help them to make those connections like this isn't just unkind to myself like it's actually affecting my health\n\nSPEAKER_01: and light bulb moment for me when you're talking like oh my goodness the anger and how we are kind of really nice people really like her community\n\nSPEAKER_00: right we're so nice which made\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know a joy\n\nSPEAKER_00: but you know who else has helped me more recently is kristen neff's work on self compassion because a lot of times when we are like hard driving we just take it out on ourself but to realize like this is really really hard like to have compassionate compassion on ourself is also really helpful and can soften the blow\n\nSPEAKER_00: all these losses yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that compassion piece is massive and also that release i remember i was interviewing daniel on this channel and he's just incredible and i learned so much from him as well but he talked about how important it is to journal your anger and i thought i'm not angry i don't have to try it so i added it to my morning journaling practice my angry but i was angry about a lot\n\nSPEAKER_01: of just i thought he was crazy so it is a little bit of that bottling and you know i was and i was born and raised in canada we're very strongly socialized to be polite and keep\n\nSPEAKER_01: waves and so yeah it's just so much happening with the emotions and our personalities and how we treat ourselves how we interact with other people it's just really really important things\n\nSPEAKER_01: incredible and get up here on the screen somewhere if you want to check it out i was giving it a watch because he's just\n\nSPEAKER_01: when you when you had this realization of what your path was going to be and you started doing all this work how long did it take you from you first started when you got to a place where you felt pretty much functionally recovered\n\nSPEAKER_00: i would say that i had that first boost which was amazing for a few days to actually like and i had been going through a really symptomatic period where i was kind of back in bed a lot of the time it was in the early winter of two thousand and eighteen and to go from that to running around the block and actually feeling pretty good was stark but then i would say it took about probably eight or nine months till i felt like i'm really recovered and even probably a year before i was adding a lot more things like back to some international travel so in the mind body way of thinking and this learned associations we're talking about because i had had these traumas happen overseas so i had the assault i had that airplane trip i told you about so when i would try to go near an airplane i mean my brain i would get so many symptoms but i started connecting this is just like a perceived danger even though i'm going to a different place so it took maybe a year to kind of get back to some more travel and being really active of course that was before the pandemic i'm not doing a lot of traveling but yeah and honestly i still incorporate this in my daily life you know i still love kind of doing a somatic meditation throughout the day if i notice myself getting stressed or pressuring myself or maybe just not feeling quite tipped top i just sort of check in what's going on emotionally notice what my thoughts are it just becomes a way of life but i think yeah it's been wow three years now feel really grateful i'm at this point where i know there's so many years where it's i would never want to go through it again honestly and i wouldn't want anyone to have to it's so hard but i am at this point where it's like i'm grateful for the ways i've grown that i don't know if i would have otherwise you know i might still be pushing myself and beating myself up and trying to really find my own sense of self esteem through my career which i largely realized i was doing to try to feel better about myself but now it comes more from inside you know there's just more acceptance and things so i think these all can be gifts like whatever your path is you know we all kind of learn these lessons and i know it's at some point that's really annoying to hear but right and i get that but i do feel yeah i live a lot more balanced peaceful life than i used to for sure\n\nSPEAKER_01: is a massive gift at this experience or it can be every single person i talk to every single person i've interviewed recovered something similar they're just a better place than they were before and they've learned so much such a weird thing like i used to my own journey i'm like do i have\n\nSPEAKER_01: a little bit myself even just thinking about being grateful for that hell what i take it away if i had choice and it's just such a crazy thing to think i don't think i would just mind blowing and i'm sure if someone had said that to me when i was really in the thick of it i would want to punch them in the face but i would just\n\nSPEAKER_00: hold it exactly but you know to me that's like a really form of going to the acceptance and healing to get to that point where it's like how i would take it away i'm grateful for what i've learned and just to kind of share that that a lot of lessons come i mean i see it as sort of like for me and i see this with a lot of people to some degree some of the things that led or fed into the symptoms not to say it was our fault there's a lot of things we don't understand about this disease but some of the things that fed into it we have the chance to kind of rebalance in ourselves and then they make the quality of life a lot better like turning self criticism into self compassion learning to take more personal empowerment in my case instead of just thinking that doctors or someone else is going to fix me or heal me and granted it wasn't their fault because i was also kind of giving them that power but realize like wow there's so much resilience inside and for me i've learned nothing's going to work unless i intuitively feel right about it like if i'm doing something as a means to an end whether it's about my health or anything else it never goes well it just never does so like retapping into that intuition has been a big one to what\n\nSPEAKER_01: did it feel like for you after so many years being unwell to relatively quickly recover after twelve or more years\n\nSPEAKER_00: i remember feeling every day waking up like a kid like oh my gosh i have energy i can go take a walk i can at that point it wasn't necessarily back to running but i can go explore the world anything i could do just felt like it was brand new like i was learning it for the first time i remember i went to a zoom class and this would have been some months in to the recovery but the teacher i mean i'm not like the most you know coordinated dancer but i do love to dance and i felt like everybody else there was like following in steps i never taken zoom but that was this craze that happened when i had c f s so i was like completely like the class is going one way i was going the other way i was so happy i was overjoyed and there must have been like eighty people in the class at the end of it the teacher came up and she's like i have never seen someone so happy in this dance class like regular zumba people so it was like i was so happy that i could dance so it is it is amazing i would kind of question it sometime and i would be like but i would have symptoms that would come up i'd have flare ups a lot so i was kind of reminded like ok when i would kind of question like is this real you know it was like it is real but it yeah it's a quality stabilize i think now things for me like maybe there's a little less of being able to do things but there's definitely more appreciation kind of more of like a stable appreciation every day for just simple things that aren't that simple when you have me right taking a walk meeting a friend being able to work big one or just do what you really want to do\n\nSPEAKER_01: i notice it a lot when i just have a really busy day and i go through this crazy day or maybe a really busy week and i mean i get a bit tired i'm still human push yourself so far\n\nSPEAKER_01: look what i can do this is incredible and i still have these moments even though like you it's not you know the little things you start used to it but i still\n\nSPEAKER_01: mirror because it took me a while to fully trust it it was like a tentative like here\n\nSPEAKER_01: might hear me gloating and it might come back it's a good it's an amazing place to finally be and i only recently just got to this place where i feel comfortable and like ok it's fully behind me it's really amazing because i know for so many of us for all those years if you like you're never going to get there we did it yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i mean recovering from c f s is the hardest thing i've ever done by far it really is amazing sometimes you kind of question it but i think that's a good thing because it makes you appreciate it right and i saw your video recently talking about i know this is behind me and it actually gave me more confidence i was like wow she's got like such certainty that's that's amazing because i think i do sometimes still question it a little bit\n\nSPEAKER_00: but it's all kind of in stages right yeah it's all stages and then you get to the point where you feel it's behind you and you've recovered but yet you have all these things you've learned and that you still integrate\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's a good place to be and that's why i just did that video because i didn't do it until now because it was the first time realizing\n\nSPEAKER_01: trusting this is behind me it's interesting\n\nSPEAKER_01: like so many of us this whole experience shapes your focus for your career your passions so porter\n\nSPEAKER_00: right no i'm not i for so many years all i wanted to do was get well and go back to being a news reporter because i really did enjoy that i knew i wanted that profession from the time i was in sixth grade you know i wrote my career report wanted to be a journalist but i changed so much along the way when i did finally recover there was just nothing in me that really wanted to go back to that i thought about it but also this the nature of news had changed it's so two hundred and forty seven now and it's a little bit insane and also i think what i was so incredibly struck by how many practitioners i went to fifty doctors and healers over the course of thirteen years i spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and the thing that helped me was this woman speaking to me like really caring about me listening to my story asking what had happened what stressors happened kind of explaining the science and i covered through that and so i just was led to train in that field even though i had recovered myself i did a number of trainings in my body training nervous system life coaching and things over a couple years and then i really call myself a mind body coach so i work with people really with all kinds of diagnosis that are generated by the brain and nervous system a lot of people with any c f s come to me but it's also people with chronic fatigue chronic headaches\n\nSPEAKER_00: back pain things like that and i should say not everything is generated by the mind and body i mean there are tumors there are fractures there are infections there are things that actually have a pathological cause that can be treated and should be treated right it's just when there's things that don't seem to have a clear cause or a clear cure that we kind of look more to this connection so yes i work with people one on one and i teach group classes because it is it is a different paradigm so i feel like\n\nSPEAKER_00: people can can learn about this approach in a really inexpensive way they can get some of the books or listen to the podcast but it is sort of important to see if it resonates or not because part of what the healing is as you heard with my light bulb moment is actually really getting it that like the cause of these symptoms and that alone can turn down the fear of the in the danger signal in the brain which calms the nervous system which calms the symptoms so because of that i started teaching classes because i saw it was really important for people to kind of have knowledge and different meditations and it's been really fun to be kind of in community with people so that's what i do now full time and i write about this quite a bit and use my journalism or writing about my body healing i blog and that kind of thing and it really does feel like my calling you know it feels like something i would just do for free because i want to do it but it has i got to this point where it's like ok either need to get another job because i'm off disability or really make this my vocation i just decided i wanted to do this full time so it's been interesting growing my own business but it's really it's from my heart and i really love it it's amazing to see people not just recover but like learn and heal and grow as people\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think that's just incredible i don't have to tell you or anybody watching that there is such\n\nSPEAKER_01: out there i think that's why so many of us are silver lining or you know another gift of this whole thing we come through it and then be compassionate about wanting to connect with the other people who are facing similar things because we see this massive gap in the medical system with millions of people in it that are just lost and alone and trying to figure this out and not getting\n\nSPEAKER_01: many of them any kind of hopeful support so on your website on like it's just\n\nSPEAKER_01: pulling each other out of this together which i think is a really incredible thing so i'm just so grateful for you and the work that you do and that you're out there providing this kind of support\n\nSPEAKER_00: thank you rayland i'm so grateful to you honestly i'm so touched by looking at how much you give out how much you put out to do this just to support the community it's clear that your heart is so in it and you just really want to help people and i know that you're a lifeline for a lot of people so thank you\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's really heartbreaking thing to see how many people are still suffering specially when you know that suffering so intimately so yeah you know i used to think when i first started doing this channel people would say reach out to me and beautiful messages because of you because of your channel and the people on your channel i have hope like\n\nSPEAKER_01: this is worth it just for that just for that and the more time people reaching out to me because of the people on your channel i found a way to recover and fully recovered again and it's just this is just\n\nSPEAKER_01: the most selfish thing i've ever done because i get so much out of it it's really rewarding so it's a good motivator to keep out of really incredible thing to be able to connect with people in this way even if you can help the teeniest tiniest little bit it's really amazing so if people want to learn more about the work that you do or follow you in social spaces how can they do that\n\nSPEAKER_00: the best way is probably through my website which is just rebeccatolan com because i have some like free somatic meditations on there if you want to try it out i have a blog i have loads of just free there's a resource page and a media page and a lot of it is sort of geared to how you can use the approach you would find in the curable app but for fatigue because a lot of people that try that approach are like they're not talking about chronic fatigue much less mecfs which we know is not just fatigue so that's really the best way i'm also on facebook but i'm just not a huge social media person so probably the website and\n\nSPEAKER_01: of course all of this will be available in the video description so for people watching just expand that and you'll find all of that there i highly encourage you to check it out and rebecca you've mentioned a lot of really great resources and books and so forth so we'll make sure to have a full list of all of those things linked below as well so if you're interested in learning more about any of these doctors or these books that rebecca has referenced that will be there and if you joined this video i've got a whole playlist of full recovery stories just like this one i'll link it up here it's just really moving really inspiring stuff and i learned something from every single one so i think yeah i'm just so grateful to people like yourself i'm grateful to you rebecca for doing this thank you so much for doing this today\n\nSPEAKER_00: oh it's so my pleasure likewise ray lynn thank you\n\nSPEAKER_01: and thank you to all of you who are watching i cannot believe the love and the support you guys throw my way with everything you're going through it's just it's so moving so i'm just trying to throw that all right back at you and give you some stuff that hopefully

so we're both in california which made scheduling this incredibly easy so grateful that she's joining me here today to talk to all of you here on my channel about her journey with any cfs she was unwell with any cfs for thirteen years before finally fully recovering so she's got a lot of really great stuff to share so i'm really excited about this thank you so much rebecca for taking the time to do\n\nSPEAKER_00: oh it's such a pleasure ray lynn i've watched your channel recently and i'm just so touched by the heart you put into it it's really clear that you're just here to support people and just offer all the different ways that helped you and helped others recover so i'm happy to share my story\n\nSPEAKER_01: i appreciate you saying that yeah it's really it's all the people like yourself put in time and effort and courage to talk about their story publicly like this\n\nSPEAKER_01: thank you very much yeah you were here to talk about your health journey so let's get into it can take us back to this all begin yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: well before the symptoms started i was in my early thirties i was tv news reporter so i had like a very busy high powered stressful job but when i really enjoyed i did a lot of international travel i socialized a lot so i was busy i exercised it kind of did all the things that you think of doing in your early thirties and\n\nSPEAKER_00: i actually went on a trip to asia just for leisure but i ended up having a really traumatic experience when i was over there i was sexually assaulted and that led to a really grueling urinary tract infection that i got on a seventeen hour plane trip back and my whole system just kind of blacked out i actually sort of lost consciousness on the plane it was really an awful experience and when i got back to the states i was just really exhausted but i was still able to work and i still kind of pushed through things and i went to a few doctors i really sort of blocked out the trauma and i wasn't able to process that on a conscious emotional level and then strangely the next year around the same time of year it was like late fall i went back to asia and i was questioning the trip because i wasn't feeling that well that time i got these three colds kind of like back to back one was when i was there in china one was on the plane trip back and then one was once i returned back to san diego and then my system completely crashed after that i just went totally kaput i felt like i had the flu twenty four seven i had a lot of the quintessential me c f s symptoms i couldn't sleep at all overnight which was really the insomnia was a grueling one for me i was so exhausted for a number of weeks and even months i would say that i could hardly just walk around the house the brain fog was really bad i felt like i couldn't remember the name of you know a good friend or a colleague digestive issues i also started getting hot flashes and kind of like pre menopausal symptoms even though i was so young so that's kind of how all it began in a nutshell\n\nSPEAKER_01: so what did you think when all this started happening\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know i was so scared ray lynn i was just really i'm sure like you and so many people can relate i was just terrified because although i had had some fatigue it started really coming on very suddenly after those viruses\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i didn't in any way think about the trauma that had happened to me or actually a previous similar assault that happened when i was nineteen none of that was in my awareness i really was just wanting to get well so i did use whatever strength i have to start researching and going to doctors and basically my mom was driving me around because i couldn't really drive or do anything i was really lucky that i lived in the same town as my parents and i sort of just started urgently going to doctors everything from allopathic medicine to natural path medicine to integrative medicine at that point to some specialists and they did diagnose me with any c f s which at that time was largely called chronic fatigue syndrome more than the me post viral syndrome some of them would say there was some fibromyalgia in there because of all the body pain although that also can be very typical with with c f s\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i think i remember thinking on the one hand i was relieved to have a diagnosis because i suddenly couldn't go to work i had to just tell my boss well you know i used to be someone who would work like sixty hours a week and i just i can't go to work anymore so it sort of helped me in that way but on the other hand it was really devastating because i remember particularly a natural path a doctor who i had so much faith in and i thought well he's you know he's natural he's going to help me recover in a really gentle way and he specialized in this diagnosis and he actually said like we we don't know what the causes and we there is no cure and really you're going to have to live with this i mean that's all i can tell you and i just remember bawling you know being so devastated and really feeling like this was just this death sentence but in a way a life sentence that i was given that i would have to live with for years\n\nSPEAKER_01: when you got this diagnosis\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think so i mean it wasn't something that i didn't know anyone that had c f s maybe distantly i had heard of it but i really didn't know much about it and of course the diagnosis chronic fatigue syndrome sounds like you're just you just need a nap but my life was like feeling like i had the flu twenty four seven and i couldn't even sleep that was really hard because i never got any relief from the symptoms i would usually sleep like a couple hours a night but no it was really new to me and i you know i had been a reporter so i started researching as much as i could and seen as many doctors as i could over really what became the next thirteen years\n\nSPEAKER_01: initial times to any of these doctors or practitioners that you were seeing recommend any sort of treatment\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah there there were all kinds of things i mean like you i think i was on tons of supplements i was on probably forty or fifty different supplements at one time and i had all my little baggies and pillboxes lined up i didn't really ever see a change with that i went to dio a doctor of osteopathy who also practiced homeopathy and she put me on the anti candida diet so actually for years i wasn't even eating you know carrots or any grains or anything like that which really wasn't a diet that i liked i had been mainly plant based before but i was willing to do whatever and those things weren't making a difference so then i started really going to more specialists neurologists endocrinologist rheumatologists the rheumatologist actually suggested antiviral intervenious drugs and i had been a bit more natural but of course i was willing to try anything so i really thought this was going to work and my entire system crashed i ended up back in bed for months after those medications\n\nSPEAKER_00: i had done a lot of iv vitamins i got really into our your veda and i do think that kind of helped me live a little more healthy balanced life and start moving back into more plant foods but it didn't shift the symptoms i went to all kinds of energy healers and i actually did see a little relief with some of the energy healers but it would just be very short lived and i would kind of go back to my baseline oh gosh i went to even sleep psych their sleep psychologists their sleep doctors by the way there's every kind of sleep expert and that was still a really vexing symptom when i wouldn't sleep the symptoms would be a lot worse the next day and eventually i started going to see some psychologists because i was starting to connect\n\nSPEAKER_00: there was a lot of psychological you know trauma and grief that happened before the onset of these symptoms and in these years i should say not to sound like this is such a sob story but i know you really place a value on just being honest with our stories there was a lot of personal griefs my father was very ill and eventually passed away about five years into my illness my mother almost died and they were like my rocks i was single engagement had broken up because it was just so hard to sustain you know he didn't he couldn't really understand why i couldn't do anything anymore i was about to lose my house i had lost the career i really loved so it was just there was a lot going on and now what what i know in how i healed i see how all those emotional stressors were really activating my brain and nervous system and making the symptoms worse i didn't really make those connections at the time but i do think some psychotherapy was helpful just to kind of talk through some of these some of these griefs that were going on\n\nSPEAKER_01: a lot of heavy hard things you're hit with i'm so sorry that you have to go through all of that how did this impact you know emotionally psychologically people understandably start feeling severe depression what was\n\nSPEAKER_00: thank you for acknowledging that i think those of us who go through this need to be acknowledged and a lot of times are really not in the health care system we're just sort of this body that is trying to get better but at times i fell into some depression i'm lucky in that i never say deep into a depression and i never really actively thought about taking my life but i remember just years where i felt like what's the point of living at all i mean on doing is taking these supplements like eating foods i don't even like for what i have no purpose anymore it was really hard to socialize too because when i would it would activate symptoms so i wasn't doing a whole lot of that other than a couple close friends and family that would come visit so it did take its toll i think though for the most part i was able to kind of keep some just some hope and some optimism although doctors were saying we don't have a cure there was something in me that was like but this isn't me like this isn't my life this is not how it's going to go i know that there's something that can get well there's something in me even that is well and that can heal on this physical level and i was always a somewhat spiritual person but i started meditating and really practicing yoga and i think that sense of spiritual connection to something that was greater than myself really helped i think it helped with my emotions and helped just feel like there was some hope and there was there was some kind of broader picture than i was able to see right now you\n\nSPEAKER_01: made a lot of changes a lot of big changes like in your lifestyle and your diet and i think a lot of us do that or asked to do that right off the start i'm just curious how you found that you know when i first got my diagnosis i was told you know more sugar gluten nor alcohol no more i mean i was drinking at the time but sugar and the gluten were still very much in my life and i had a raging sugar addiction and then i was just sent home and just like make all these changes live off of ko and it was really tough for me and then a lot of self you know because i was sticking to this plan all the time it was supposed to help so what was the process like for you making all of these changes oh my\n\nSPEAKER_00: gosh i can relate to all of that you know it was like not only are you totally miserable but we're going to take away anything you enjoy eating which is like one of the few kind of pleasures left so i was also on you know the gluten free dairy free sugar free i also i couldn't drink any caffeine or alcohol if i would just have a sip i would be shot for days even more so\n\nSPEAKER_00: i was on the elimination diet so there was just basically i was eating like protein usually either chicken or fish and cooked vegetables because i would get really bloated if i would have salad so yeah it was it was kind of miserable i mean it just sort of felt like this deprivation and i think too in looking back there was a part of me that really resented it because i didn't feel like i was an active participant at that point in my own healing you know really felt like i went to sort of more natural pathogen doctors because i thought there is going to be more inclusionary but in a lot of ways it was still like ok there take this medication take this supplement take this herb do this diet and i just sort of felt like it was being done to me and actually i did have a really perceptive doctor years later i saw for the c f s and although he didn't really help me with the symptoms he helped me emotionally because actually he said you know what i think you think i'm going to tell you to take a bunch more supplements and more restrictive diets and i suspect that's actually perpetuating the trauma in which you felt you were in control of your body and now you're just being told what to do with your body by all these medical professionals and rayland i just started crying i was like someone sees me and i didn't even know that's how i felt but i think for those of us even if there isn't a trauma what i find with other people i meet who have c f s is often if not always there's a lot of stress beforehand and there can be a sense then whether it was existent before or certainly after the diagnosis of just being so powerless and so i started realizing with diet and everything else at some point i have to regain my agency and my power and my collaboration in my healing because otherwise i was resenting it and i and i just i think those diets didn't work partly because of that and partly because the root cause of my c f s was not that i wasn't eating enough kale right that wasn't the cause or that i wasn't taking thirty supplements a day\n\nSPEAKER_01: such a good point one of the things that i just love about these interviews is that i learned something about my own journey and i get more insight every single person i talk to hadn't really thought about you know and i make when i made the switch later on in my journey to plant based it was so easy i did it effortlessly but it was my choice and i had just it was my idea and i believed in it so in the beginning when those were imposed on me it was really challenging and i found even though i was thought i was committed i was forever trying to find work around like ok i can't have gluten i can't have sugar i really want some chicken fingers so i took some chicken and cornflakes and i deep fry them and then i think the sauce made out of like stevia\n\nSPEAKER_01: or you know like not healthy food at all but there was no sugar\n\nSPEAKER_01: right make all these desserts that were like raisins and somehow maple syrup and like why didn't sugar in there so i like diet sodas like diet orange soda so i get\n\nSPEAKER_01: myself up in the beginning with so much crap trying to like find me like ok\n\nSPEAKER_00: absolutely and especially i remember watching a video where you were talking about you know for me i just feel better on plant based diets and that's what i found too and so i think especially if you're being asked to eat in a way that just doesn't feel right to your body for whatever reason not that there is one right or wrong diet but for you there's going to be resentment you're right you're going to try to find ways around it that are necessarily nutritional\n\nSPEAKER_01: so what happened what\n\nSPEAKER_00: so let's see i think that you know this whole thirteen year saga had different phases and and i would say the first five years i was really impaired meaning i couldn't do much out of the house i mean i could still take care of myself which was really nice but my parents would bring groceries and things\n\nSPEAKER_00: then i would say like the next maybe five or six years i had a little more ability and mobility and i could do things like i could go to a local yoga studio and i would notice when i would do things that i would enjoy especially that was really calming and soothing i would get a little more energy so i mean i was doing like a lot of restorative yoga but still i was getting out i could see friends a little bit more but like not in the evenings if i saw a friend in the evening i have insomnia i wouldn't sleep all night\n\nSPEAKER_00: so but what i really noticed over time was kind of back to this point of personal agency and starting to like tune into really what works for me was i noticed when i would be in nature which i really loved when i would read poetry or i love listening to eckhart tolle i actually couldn't read a lot that was the thing because of the brain fog i could only really read people like eckhart tolle because he writes a few words and it means so much or i could read poetry because it was just a few words right but i started really getting into that i started writing poetry i started actually just more doing what gave me a little bit of peace or relief rather than just trying to fix myself and get rid of the symptoms wasn't that i totally gave up on it but i would say i mean this took well over a decade to kind of like get off the roller coaster because i just noticed again and again i was so exasperated by trying every last diet every supplement every i mean i one point i was doing like enemas every single night all these rituals deep detoxes ten days worth and i was just like none of these things have worked and so i just kind of started tuning into my own self and my own body and then i had this one experience which actually ended up being a blessing where i thought oh i'll try one more healer so this woman was supposedly a shamanic healer she was like a white woman in san diego who had done a little bit of training in the amazon and so she i went in for a session with her and she was kind of smoking her pipe and she asked me about the trauma and i actually started opening up for some reason and really crying and she changed the subject and said you know i don't think we should talk about this let's talk about my cat which i'm dressing up for halloween and so i think somehow she got triggered or something but i felt so shut down and so numb after that and i wrote her out a two hundred dollars check i left there numb and i was just like i am never going to give away my power to someone else like here i'm thinking this woman who's not even listening to me who's shutting me down is going to heal me and it's just not going to happen not to say i didn't think i needed help from people or that we don't need support but it shifted kind of the power dynamic because the situation with her was so ridiculous you know that i was paying her two hundred dollars to tell me about her cat costume now about twelve years in something happened i was actually meditating a lot i got me into transcendental meditation and kind of the inner teachings of yoga which really teach us that everything on the outside including our health comes from our internal state at least there's some origin with you know our minds and so i was just fascinated with all these philosophies and studies practices and it lit me up and i felt like i got to this point where some kind of surrender happened and i know that sounds really cliche but it's hard to describe i fell into this state of peace there was actually mental peace even though i still had the same symptoms and i kind of was almost observing myself there would be intense flu like you know aching but i felt it in my body but i was kind of watching it and there was this internal state of nonresistance or peace and it really wasn't something i tried to do although i had been studying about it but it kind of happened and interestingly that went on for a year i mean so it didn't actually shift the physical symptoms but i sort of was it's not like i wanted them to be there i mean this was this whole situation sucked it was treacherous it was a grueling but at that point somehow i wasn't fighting it and so i feel like from that place i really wasn't pursuing medical interventions i was eating what i wanted which which is like mostly plant based organic whole foods i just like that you know it felt good to my body it was kind of like intuition nutrition i would i couldn't work i was on disability and there was that bothered me i mean i wanted a purpose i wanted to contribute but i just kind of accepted this is where i am right now and so from that place interestingly as i started just like pursuing what i enjoyed i took this online writing class called right into light and i met this woman and she said oh i recovered from c f s through this type of mind body work if you want we can set up a phone conversation and i also got migraine so i was like well i can only talk on the phone for ten minutes but yeah i would love to do that\n\nSPEAKER_00: so we set up this conversation we start talking and she starts telling me all her symptoms were exactly the same you know and she had epstein bar and she had all these things and that she made this total recovery well i told her i could talk for ten minutes three hours later i actually got up and ran around the block like i had not ran in thirteen years i had something of like a mini spontaneous remission now this was not the end of the story you know symptoms did come back so i don't want people to think oh that doesn't happen to me it can't happen but what that conversation showed me was that i could recover and what really changed for me was she explained that all these years doctors had been saying these viruses were suppressing my immune system so it was like the epstein bar and ten other viruses that i just couldn't overcome and so to me i felt like that's this insurmountable physical thing but she explained she had all those diagnoses she had all those viral titers and what happened was she learned that it was more how her brain and nervous system were processing stress and just stuck in this hyper vigilant mode and essentially her brain had learned these patterns these neuropathways and she recovered and at the end of this conversation now you would think this would be infuriating but by this point i was so with her she said rebecca you're not sick you know and i think she kind of alluded you're just you're stressed you've been through trauma your system stuck in this pattern but you can get out of it and i believed it i believed it one hundred percent like i felt it in all of me and my body reacted with that that burst of energy at least in that moment\n\nSPEAKER_01: wow so in that conversation it wasn't even as if you were doing some sort of you know therapy or work on yourself it was just this breakthrough of understanding of what was happening and it gave you this break from symptoms at least for a little bit exactly\n\nSPEAKER_00: exactly and that's a really good point because i think for me what the key was even though this woman wasn't a therapist she wasn't a doctor she and i had been a science journalist so i love science and she kind of explained the science of what can happen in our brain and nervous system with chronic fatigue chronic pain brain fog with all these symptoms and it made sense to me and so i felt like she was literally rediagnosing me which is crazy because she's not a medical professional but i felt like i can overcome this because it's now a matter of understanding this knowledge learning how i can calm down my nervous system start feeling my emotions start challenging myself more like getting back to more activities to sort of retrain my brain and it was kind of like to me and i'm not saying this is for everybody but for me i felt like i finally heard the truth like this resonated with me with what was happening and it gave me hope that i could recover instead of just being like viruses or faulty genes or mitochondria or things i couldn't do anything about\n\nSPEAKER_00: and after i had that little spontaneous remission i ran around the block multiple times i knew i was on the right path i knew beyond a shadow of a doubt and that's all it was was knowledge i mean it was just information which is really crazy and i think it was her caring like she cared a lot to help me she spent three hours on the phone with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: absolutely incredible and it just it makes me question so many things about my own experience in my own story and you're talking about food and for years i couldn't eat rice it made me incredibly sick it was one of my food intolerances and even after i recovered i still have some rice feel sick i was terrified of rice and i lived in asia for eight and a half years so that was a challenging situation but just recently i just started trying having little tiny bits like oh i feel okay let's try to have a little bit more oh i feel okay and now i can eat copious amounts and i'm fine and i just assumed okay my body must have healed it but now i'm thinking you know it might have just been a brain association all those years that i had built up triggering that response and then as i built that confidence with like a little bit i'm ok a little bit i'm okay brought up and socialized not to attribute attribute our physical symptoms to something that's being caused by the brain like we don't even see the connection at all like there's a wall here where this stuff starts where this stuff starts and it's just exactly to see that that's\n\nSPEAKER_00: not the case so fascinating well exactly and you know what's so interesting we're raised like you say to see like a physical symptom has to have a physical cause but now there's actually a whole body of neuroscience and scientific research showing that there's just two studies out this year one out of harvard and one out of boulder but the basically shows chronic pain is caused and cured by a form of brain retraining by this specific approach because the brain generates pain and it generates pain as well as fatigue because it senses danger but that danger can be psychological as well as physical it's the same part of the brain that perceives it and so what's so ironic is that the doctor i ended up studying with to train in this howard schubiner who i highly recommend his book called unlearn your pain and he talks about fatigue he talks about these food sensitivities as well and he really helped me see it's like not necessarily that some food is bad for us or some behavior is that our brain perceives it so if you eat a poisonous berry the next time you see that berry you'll get queasy because your brain via your body is trained to protect you but you might see another berry like a blueberry and you could get queasy because that part of the brain the emotional limbic centers aren't like particularly discriminating they're just sort of picking up information in our environment and if we're stressed or in our nervous system hypervigilant they can mistake that like rice isn't good for me or whatever we're told by our doctors isn't good but this dr schupner actually led me to believe and it became true that i could eat all these foods it's just that my brain had become so scared of them so of course this is not true with an actual like food allergy like peanuts and things i mean that really does exist but with the sensitivities to food i know it kind of blows your mind and i'm not trying to say that people should just start eating all these things i mean you have to decide for yourself but what you're describing to me is interesting that it sounds very similar when you can kind of retrain yourself that you know it wasn't an innate food allergy it's an association or a condition response it's like pavlov's dog right it's the same dynamic\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah and i think thank you for taking the time to explain all that because i think that's an important distinction because i think a lot of us myself included sometimes get a bit put back or like are you saying just imagining this whole thing and it's not that it doesn't exist you know our brain is a very real part of our body it's another organ that we have so it is creating conditions in our body it is something that is real it's just not maybe caused by the organ that we think is causing it it's originating from a different place in the body\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i'm so glad you said that because i know like all of us who have dealt with cfs we've been told like you're making this up or we've been doubted so i so get that people are sensitive to this and these symptoms are a hundred percent real and the people who i've mentioned dr sarno and dr schubiner whose work really helped me they're very clear this is a hundred percent real but like you said the brain is like the master control so like we know the brain and the nervous system are constantly scanning for danger and if they sense it they'll go into flight fight or freeze mode to protect you so either to help you to run or fight and you're flooded with stress hormones or to shut you down if the danger seems too big i think with cfs the danger seems too big a lot of times and we become frozen and our brain and nervous system is trying to help us it's creating real physical symptoms they could not be more real\n\nSPEAKER_00: but in my case at least i came to believe that the things i was told were causing the symptoms were more like effects like the epstein bar i'm sure was higher because my brain and nervous system weren't functioning optimally and so when you're prepared to run or fight your digestion is not a priority your hormones aren't a priority all these other things are not working as well that's true the immune system isn't a priority but what i found for me is that wasn't the answer because that was the effect not the cause and the cause was like going to the brain but also like not to say this is caused by emotions because i know that can put people off and they can think oh i'm being told i'm just emotional or depressed it's not that at all but one thing i really feel is missing in the medical system is acknowledging we are living breathing feeling human beings and back to when darwin wrote about the evolutionary value of emotions emotions are actually what tells our brain and nervous system whether we're safe or not safe whether to trigger the flight fight freeze response right if there's fear that response the nerve firing patterns change\n\nSPEAKER_00: the hormones change to help us so emotions are the cue so to act like i just felt like doctors didn't ever ask once was there anything stressful possibly happening in your life before you went from being this active tv news reporter to being homebound no one asked that and it's like where's the heart and the humanity much less the neuroscience and i don't mean to blame or implicate i know everybody's doing their best but i think we need like more trauma informed care and even more understanding that the brain and the nervous system do react from fear in perpetuating symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_01: i find it really interesting you talked about the pain because there's so many people who are living with chronic pain and unfortunately with my experience i had some but it wasn't serious and i just i don't know how people function with that level of chronic pain in their life and then recently i reviewed the curable app because people kept telling me about it and through that process just learning about the app how it works reading reviews reaching out to people the mecfs community asking about their experience with it and a lot of people are having significant success or completely having their pain gone because of using this and it is coming from the premise that the chronic pain is originating in the brain so is that all part of like the process of your recovery is there something similar\n\nSPEAKER_00: such a great question i'm really glad to see curable and other things like that are kind of gaining more acceptance curable is based on this exact same approach so one of the doctors i mentioned howard schubiner is on the board of curable john sarno has passed away but he was kind of considered the early pioneer in this so curable is based on this and i actually discovered not the curable app but john sarno's work in this this whole mind body approach much earlier in my cfs journey but i discovered sarno's book healing back pain which by the way back pain neck pain all these chronic pains are also usually caused by the brain and nervous system rather than a structural issue but i couldn't see how to apply that to myself it was like but i have exhaustion i have brain fog i have all these other things and i think when i met that woman i'm ever grateful for kathy and she explained she used a very similar approach as curable and she just sort of used fatigue as a synonym and later i reached out to howard schubiner and\n\nSPEAKER_00: did a training with him and i asked him and he said it's the same thing because if you think of fatigue there's a part of you that doesn't feel safe and it's sort of like your system's trying to like shut you down and like keep you at home and it did feel like that for me like i think there was a perception this is subconscious by the way because ninety percent of our brain and emotions including our emotions are subconscious so we're not aware of them but i think that for me there was this perception like the world's not safe anymore after that assault and it was sort of like my system trying to keep me at home now it is a bit of a painful way to try to protect you but you know this we're dealing with also kind of some reptilian parts of the brain fear based parts of the brain but anyway to go to your point i haven't done the curable app because i already recovered through some of the other books and through coaching but it's it's really the same approach and people can apply it to brain fog and digestive issues and fatigue as well so\n\nSPEAKER_01: my body approach what would one day one week in your life look like\n\nSPEAKER_00: so do you mean like more when i was recovering or just today yet more when i was recovering ok so yeah both because i still i still integrate it but i would say when i was still over that first year i was every day doing these meditations called somatic tracking so i'm really glad curable i'm told by some of my clients now has somatic tracking meditations on there but basically you don't even need a meditation but it's helpful to be guided where you're just kind of tracking sensations in your body so it's like the fatigue might end up feeling like you know heaviness through your whole body or say i would have a lot of burning in my arm so i would bring my mind into that but you're getting these messages of safety like i'm safe and ok there's actually nothing wrong with my body so you're kind of retraining your brain and i would do that every day i would actually do it every night as well and i feel like it broke the insomnia habit and i say habit because that's also kind of a subconscious learned behavior that the bed becomes associated with anxiety so i would do the somatic tracking usually a few different meditations every day i would i just love reading the books there's different podcasts on this approach curable has one there's others that i really like called tell me about your pain is one of them so i was learning about it and then i would like go and start to do things i was like oh i'm going to go try to walk a half a mile or a mile or something at this point i would just walk a little more and i would notice the symptoms so as i'm doing it the symptoms are rising i'm getting that malaise and i would just be like reiterate like you know i'm ok i got this i i know what's going on and that's like how you retrain your brain that you can do these things which i think a lot of people do anyway through graded exposure you know honestly it doesn't take a lot of time this approach it's kind of just learning it doing the meditations i would see this coach once a week in the beginning then every other week and just started really adding on activities to my life including food i started eating more things that i wanted and at first like you do have a reaction because your brain thinks that's not good for you but then within usually a few times i could just eat it ok it's crazy i know it does sort of seem wild and i think that there has to be a certain pacing and timing with this because i'll say i was really ready i would have been able to just jump into this years before when for one i didn't really believe it and i was bed bound so i mean just to have like compassion for people i think that was another thing i really brought in raylan and again it's not that it took time but i started bringing in self compassion when i would get symptoms i would just ask how am i feeling emotionally because with this work you want to bring it back to the emotions because we so focus on the physical symptoms but you really want to tend to the emotions which are driving the state of the nervous system so it's like how am i feeling emotionally and i would acknowledge i'm scared i'm really scared i'm really frustrated and then i would just kind of be compassionate with myself and i still am to this day like that's really hard you know just talk to myself i'm so sorry what do you what do you want or need right now instead of just pushing myself i would challenge myself but if i needed to back down i would and sometimes take a break and just kind of tune into like what do you want or need it just has gotten to be and now over it's been a few years a much more kind of personal attentive way of dealing with yourself i mean it sounds funny to be talking to yourself but i think we all do anyway so it's just doing it in a much more compassionate way where i used to beat myself up like you had said for not recovering i was like i'm failing what's wrong with me you know and i mean that dr schumer and others will explain that self criticism actually does activate the danger alarm signal in the brain and the nervous system so it actually can feed into symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_00: and so yeah just being a lot more like compassionate with myself like this is really hard but we can do hard things and we'll pick it back up when when it's time\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i know you and i have talked about before\n\nSPEAKER_01: personality traits but some people at least\n\nSPEAKER_01: is kind of illnesses people who drive themselves hard people who are critical of themselves so do you think that plays a role in symptom perpetuation or impacts recovery in some way\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know when people read john sarno's books and there's one called the mind body prescription and he describes the personality type of people who get chronic symptoms and he does talk about c f s but he also talks about chronic pain and other symptoms that he believes had an origin in the brain and nervous system and he describes like perfectionist check right people pleasers check maybe you're doing things for other people instead of for yourself people who are like really conscientious hard driving\n\nSPEAKER_00: put a lot of pressure on themselves to do things well and i just felt like i was seeing myself in those pages and as i meet people with c f s and you meet so many people\n\nSPEAKER_00: i do see that pattern a lot like we're and also and not just that with myself with a lot of people i meet it's like not only are we putting all this pressure and stress and even sometimes criticism on ourselves but we're holding the emotions it so it becomes kind of like a pressure cooker right like if you have a water that's boiling with the lid on eventually it's going to burst because we're holding in all the pressures i remember i know i keep bringing him up but he's such a kind man and i think he's really very forward looking but dr schubiner in a training was saying people who get c f s and these chronic symptoms they're really nice people like i get to work with the nicest people right because it's not people who take out their stuff on other people but the flip side of that is like kind of holding in the emotions\n\nSPEAKER_00: part of that too i'll throw in i did some journaling like expressive writing to kind of like really just get out all the frustration i didn't mention that earlier in my practices but just to kind of like let myself really journal and write about anything that i'm too nice to say to anyone\n\nSPEAKER_00: that that was actually that was helpful and then yeah back to your point the personality traits i think just learning that you know we all kind of learn this with with any c f s like we can't be perfectionists right like some of us i mean i was lucky if i could just take a shower some days so it kind of softened and that was that was a good thing but then when i recovered and went back to work i did see some of those tendencies come back and i do actively work with it where i'll notice if i'm pushing too hard like if i'm feeling stressed or pressure like i got to gotta got to get these things done i can start getting a little fatigue and i can also start getting i recovered from interstitial cystitis through the same work the bladder pain i can get like little hints of it but i'm always able to link it to like emotional stress either that happened to me or that i put myself under\n\nSPEAKER_00: and once i'm aware of it usually the symptoms subside or sometimes i'll do like the somatic tracking meditation i mentioned to you or something like that but i think i softened you know i still i still have some of that you know i don't think we have to like totally change who we are to get well again but i found it was a wake up call to be more kind to myself and more authentic in who i always was where i think in many ways before i liked my life as a t v news reporter but in a lot of ways it wasn't really me i mean i do tend to like a quieter more introspective life i like to do more writing and i think a lot of times it's like more finding who you really are and who you really are in treating yourself like you would treat a good friend i think these things can actually help more than we know and they have helped me a lot and i feel with a lot of people that it can really help them to make those connections like this isn't just unkind to myself like it's actually affecting my health\n\nSPEAKER_01: and light bulb moment for me when you're talking like oh my goodness the anger and how we are kind of really nice people really like her community\n\nSPEAKER_00: right we're so nice which made\n\nSPEAKER_00: you know a joy\n\nSPEAKER_00: but you know who else has helped me more recently is kristen neff's work on self compassion because a lot of times when we are like hard driving we just take it out on ourself but to realize like this is really really hard like to have compassionate compassion on ourself is also really helpful and can soften the blow\n\nSPEAKER_00: all these losses yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that compassion piece is massive and also that release i remember i was interviewing daniel on this channel and he's just incredible and i learned so much from him as well but he talked about how important it is to journal your anger and i thought i'm not angry i don't have to try it so i added it to my morning journaling practice my angry but i was angry about a lot\n\nSPEAKER_01: of just i thought he was crazy so it is a little bit of that bottling and you know i was and i was born and raised in canada we're very strongly socialized to be polite and keep\n\nSPEAKER_01: waves and so yeah it's just so much happening with the emotions and our personalities and how we treat ourselves how we interact with other people it's just really really important things\n\nSPEAKER_01: incredible and get up here on the screen somewhere if you want to check it out i was giving it a watch because he's just\n\nSPEAKER_01: when you when you had this realization of what your path was going to be and you started doing all this work how long did it take you from you first started when you got to a place where you felt pretty much functionally recovered\n\nSPEAKER_00: i would say that i had that first boost which was amazing for a few days to actually like and i had been going through a really symptomatic period where i was kind of back in bed a lot of the time it was in the early winter of two thousand and eighteen and to go from that to running around the block and actually feeling pretty good was stark but then i would say it took about probably eight or nine months till i felt like i'm really recovered and even probably a year before i was adding a lot more things like back to some international travel so in the mind body way of thinking and this learned associations we're talking about because i had had these traumas happen overseas so i had the assault i had that airplane trip i told you about so when i would try to go near an airplane i mean my brain i would get so many symptoms but i started connecting this is just like a perceived danger even though i'm going to a different place so it took maybe a year to kind of get back to some more travel and being really active of course that was before the pandemic i'm not doing a lot of traveling but yeah and honestly i still incorporate this in my daily life you know i still love kind of doing a somatic meditation throughout the day if i notice myself getting stressed or pressuring myself or maybe just not feeling quite tipped top i just sort of check in what's going on emotionally notice what my thoughts are it just becomes a way of life but i think yeah it's been wow three years now feel really grateful i'm at this point where i know there's so many years where it's i would never want to go through it again honestly and i wouldn't want anyone to have to it's so hard but i am at this point where it's like i'm grateful for the ways i've grown that i don't know if i would have otherwise you know i might still be pushing myself and beating myself up and trying to really find my own sense of self esteem through my career which i largely realized i was doing to try to feel better about myself but now it comes more from inside you know there's just more acceptance and things so i think these all can be gifts like whatever your path is you know we all kind of learn these lessons and i know it's at some point that's really annoying to hear but right and i get that but i do feel yeah i live a lot more balanced peaceful life than i used to for sure\n\nSPEAKER_01: is a massive gift at this experience or it can be every single person i talk to every single person i've interviewed recovered something similar they're just a better place than they were before and they've learned so much such a weird thing like i used to my own journey i'm like do i have\n\nSPEAKER_01: a little bit myself even just thinking about being grateful for that hell what i take it away if i had choice and it's just such a crazy thing to think i don't think i would just mind blowing and i'm sure if someone had said that to me when i was really in the thick of it i would want to punch them in the face but i would just\n\nSPEAKER_00: hold it exactly but you know to me that's like a really form of going to the acceptance and healing to get to that point where it's like how i would take it away i'm grateful for what i've learned and just to kind of share that that a lot of lessons come i mean i see it as sort of like for me and i see this with a lot of people to some degree some of the things that led or fed into the symptoms not to say it was our fault there's a lot of things we don't understand about this disease but some of the things that fed into it we have the chance to kind of rebalance in ourselves and then they make the quality of life a lot better like turning self criticism into self compassion learning to take more personal empowerment in my case instead of just thinking that doctors or someone else is going to fix me or heal me and granted it wasn't their fault because i was also kind of giving them that power but realize like wow there's so much resilience inside and for me i've learned nothing's going to work unless i intuitively feel right about it like if i'm doing something as a means to an end whether it's about my health or anything else it never goes well it just never does so like retapping into that intuition has been a big one to what\n\nSPEAKER_01: did it feel like for you after so many years being unwell to relatively quickly recover after twelve or more years\n\nSPEAKER_00: i remember feeling every day waking up like a kid like oh my gosh i have energy i can go take a walk i can at that point it wasn't necessarily back to running but i can go explore the world anything i could do just felt like it was brand new like i was learning it for the first time i remember i went to a zoom class and this would have been some months in to the recovery but the teacher i mean i'm not like the most you know coordinated dancer but i do love to dance and i felt like everybody else there was like following in steps i never taken zoom but that was this craze that happened when i had c f s so i was like completely like the class is going one way i was going the other way i was so happy i was overjoyed and there must have been like eighty people in the class at the end of it the teacher came up and she's like i have never seen someone so happy in this dance class like regular zumba people so it was like i was so happy that i could dance so it is it is amazing i would kind of question it sometime and i would be like but i would have symptoms that would come up i'd have flare ups a lot so i was kind of reminded like ok when i would kind of question like is this real you know it was like it is real but it yeah it's a quality stabilize i think now things for me like maybe there's a little less of being able to do things but there's definitely more appreciation kind of more of like a stable appreciation every day for just simple things that aren't that simple when you have me right taking a walk meeting a friend being able to work big one or just do what you really want to do\n\nSPEAKER_01: i notice it a lot when i just have a really busy day and i go through this crazy day or maybe a really busy week and i mean i get a bit tired i'm still human push yourself so far\n\nSPEAKER_01: look what i can do this is incredible and i still have these moments even though like you it's not you know the little things you start used to it but i still\n\nSPEAKER_01: mirror because it took me a while to fully trust it it was like a tentative like here\n\nSPEAKER_01: might hear me gloating and it might come back it's a good it's an amazing place to finally be and i only recently just got to this place where i feel comfortable and like ok it's fully behind me it's really amazing because i know for so many of us for all those years if you like you're never going to get there we did it yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i mean recovering from c f s is the hardest thing i've ever done by far it really is amazing sometimes you kind of question it but i think that's a good thing because it makes you appreciate it right and i saw your video recently talking about i know this is behind me and it actually gave me more confidence i was like wow she's got like such certainty that's that's amazing because i think i do sometimes still question it a little bit\n\nSPEAKER_00: but it's all kind of in stages right yeah it's all stages and then you get to the point where you feel it's behind you and you've recovered but yet you have all these things you've learned and that you still integrate\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's a good place to be and that's why i just did that video because i didn't do it until now because it was the first time realizing\n\nSPEAKER_01: trusting this is behind me it's interesting\n\nSPEAKER_01: like so many of us this whole experience shapes your focus for your career your passions so porter\n\nSPEAKER_00: right no i'm not i for so many years all i wanted to do was get well and go back to being a news reporter because i really did enjoy that i knew i wanted that profession from the time i was in sixth grade you know i wrote my career report wanted to be a journalist but i changed so much along the way when i did finally recover there was just nothing in me that really wanted to go back to that i thought about it but also this the nature of news had changed it's so two hundred and forty seven now and it's a little bit insane and also i think what i was so incredibly struck by how many practitioners i went to fifty doctors and healers over the course of thirteen years i spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and the thing that helped me was this woman speaking to me like really caring about me listening to my story asking what had happened what stressors happened kind of explaining the science and i covered through that and so i just was led to train in that field even though i had recovered myself i did a number of trainings in my body training nervous system life coaching and things over a couple years and then i really call myself a mind body coach so i work with people really with all kinds of diagnosis that are generated by the brain and nervous system a lot of people with any c f s come to me but it's also people with chronic fatigue chronic headaches\n\nSPEAKER_00: back pain things like that and i should say not everything is generated by the mind and body i mean there are tumors there are fractures there are infections there are things that actually have a pathological cause that can be treated and should be treated right it's just when there's things that don't seem to have a clear cause or a clear cure that we kind of look more to this connection so yes i work with people one on one and i teach group classes because it is it is a different paradigm so i feel like\n\nSPEAKER_00: people can can learn about this approach in a really inexpensive way they can get some of the books or listen to the podcast but it is sort of important to see if it resonates or not because part of what the healing is as you heard with my light bulb moment is actually really getting it that like the cause of these symptoms and that alone can turn down the fear of the in the danger signal in the brain which calms the nervous system which calms the symptoms so because of that i started teaching classes because i saw it was really important for people to kind of have knowledge and different meditations and it's been really fun to be kind of in community with people so that's what i do now full time and i write about this quite a bit and use my journalism or writing about my body healing i blog and that kind of thing and it really does feel like my calling you know it feels like something i would just do for free because i want to do it but it has i got to this point where it's like ok either need to get another job because i'm off disability or really make this my vocation i just decided i wanted to do this full time so it's been interesting growing my own business but it's really it's from my heart and i really love it it's amazing to see people not just recover but like learn and heal and grow as people\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think that's just incredible i don't have to tell you or anybody watching that there is such\n\nSPEAKER_01: out there i think that's why so many of us are silver lining or you know another gift of this whole thing we come through it and then be compassionate about wanting to connect with the other people who are facing similar things because we see this massive gap in the medical system with millions of people in it that are just lost and alone and trying to figure this out and not getting\n\nSPEAKER_01: many of them any kind of hopeful support so on your website on like it's just\n\nSPEAKER_01: pulling each other out of this together which i think is a really incredible thing so i'm just so grateful for you and the work that you do and that you're out there providing this kind of support\n\nSPEAKER_00: thank you rayland i'm so grateful to you honestly i'm so touched by looking at how much you give out how much you put out to do this just to support the community it's clear that your heart is so in it and you just really want to help people and i know that you're a lifeline for a lot of people so thank you\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's really heartbreaking thing to see how many people are still suffering specially when you know that suffering so intimately so yeah you know i used to think when i first started doing this channel people would say reach out to me and beautiful messages because of you because of your channel and the people on your channel i have hope like\n\nSPEAKER_01: this is worth it just for that just for that and the more time people reaching out to me because of the people on your channel i found a way to recover and fully recovered again and it's just this is just\n\nSPEAKER_01: the most selfish thing i've ever done because i get so much out of it it's really rewarding so it's a good motivator to keep out of really incredible thing to be able to connect with people in this way even if you can help the teeniest tiniest little bit it's really amazing so if people want to learn more about the work that you do or follow you in social spaces how can they do that\n\nSPEAKER_00: the best way is probably through my website which is just rebeccatolan com because i have some like free somatic meditations on there if you want to try it out i have a blog i have loads of just free there's a resource page and a media page and a lot of it is sort of geared to how you can use the approach you would find in the curable app but for fatigue because a lot of people that try that approach are like they're not talking about chronic fatigue much less mecfs which we know is not just fatigue so that's really the best way i'm also on facebook but i'm just not a huge social media person so probably the website and\n\nSPEAKER_01: of course all of this will be available in the video description so for people watching just expand that and you'll find all of that there i highly encourage you to check it out and rebecca you've mentioned a lot of really great resources and books and so forth so we'll make sure to have a full list of all of those things linked below as well so if you're interested in learning more about any of these doctors or these books that rebecca has referenced that will be there and if you joined this video i've got a whole playlist of full recovery stories just like this one i'll link it up here it's just really moving really inspiring stuff and i learned something from every single one so i think yeah i'm just so grateful to people like yourself i'm grateful to you rebecca for doing this thank you so much for doing this today\n\nSPEAKER_00: oh it's so my pleasure likewise ray lynn thank you\n\nSPEAKER_01: and thank you to all of you who are watching i cannot believe the love and the support you guys throw my way with everything you're going through it's just it's so moving so i'm just trying to throw that all right back at you and give you some stuff that hopefully

is possible it usually takes a while rapid recoveries are the exception but they are incredibly exciting when they do happen and today's interview is an example of just that hi everyone i'm ralan if you're new here welcome on this channel we explore recovery strategies and share real life stories every week to learn as much as we can from each other in fact these interviews are now part of a research study to discover what helps most people regain their health i'm super excited to have kelly with us today over in new york just four months after starting a recovery program she completed a ten k run and is now training for a full marathon so let's dive in and hear about her incredible journey and how she went from barely making it through the day to now running incredibly long distances kelly so great to have you here today thank you so much for being here and sharing your story yes thank you for having me so take us back you know to the beginning or before the beginning how did you how did this all start for you how did you start to notice that you something was off and you were well\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah so i typically am a very active person and i usually have a lot of energy to do different activities but there is a phase in my life where i just started to get really tired and i didn't have the motivation to go out and do as many activities and so i just started to notice things like laying in bed i would get these canker sores and just overall not feeling the best\n\nSPEAKER_00: and did you go to see a doctor what did you think was happening\n\nSPEAKER_01: i did go get my blood work done i thought maybe it was low iron or my electrolytes but my blood work came out pretty good and i thought maybe it was something mentally that was causing this\n\nSPEAKER_00: and what made you think that\n\nSPEAKER_01: just because i went to multiple doctors and they all said the same thing that everything was perfectly fine for my vitals my blood work but still i was getting lightheaded when i was standing up i didn't have as much focus during the day and the worst symptom was the mouth sores which i thought maybe had to do with me not handling my stress well\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay so it sounds like the doctors essentially sent you away with nothing and you were left to figure this out on your own so what did you do from there\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i heard about this program i can thrive and i was referred to the program by a family member and so i went to therapist before this to try to figure out some skills but none of them were as helpful as this program that i started to use\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay i've had jason on the channel before that's jason mctiernan's program correct i can thrive yeah i've interviewed a lot of people actually on the channel who have gone through his program and have recovered and interviewed him himself he's a great guy so what was it like going through the program for you and how did you find how do you think that it helped you to get past this and get where you are now\n\nSPEAKER_01: in the beginning i was a little skeptical because the program does have like a hypnosis type of effect in it where you're going through and imagining yourself at ease in a situation and trying to bring that into the future so i never really had that type of technique but once i really committed to learning the program it really made a difference and i could use all these little techniques in situations when i'm by myself such as like when i was driving in the car i get anxious and you really train your brain to think differently\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it is the whole program is based around i know a big component of it is this brain retraining piece which so many people are finding incredibly helpful with their journey had you heard of anything like this before you started doing this\n\nSPEAKER_01: i heard of going to a hypnotist which i never went to but i know some people like that i also heard of the emdr techniques for therapy so i movement desensitization and reprocessing but i never really tried his method\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just i asked because it can be a different way of thinking about healing than we usually do when our doctors tell us from what we grew up hearing about how you get well typically some sort of medication or surgery or something so to work with your brain to heal your body is a completely paradigm shift that we're in right now understanding healing and symptoms so once you started doing the program how quickly did you start to see progress\n\nSPEAKER_01: i started to see it maybe two weeks after it was pretty quick and compared to some other cases i know jason said that mine was a quicker recovery but yeah it really changed within six months i was back to feeling fully well\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow and since then you're even running ten k races can you tell us about that and what did that feel like\n\nSPEAKER_01: that was great my first ten k that i ran that year it was just motivating me to get back out there and challenge my body with physical activities right now i'm training for a full marathon with some of my friends and before i don't think i would have had the mental stamina to do that and now i just have that positive affirmations and changing the way of my mindset from fix to growth and it really has made a difference\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah going through these things does seem to transform people it's a horrible thing to go through but thankfully there's a lot of good that comes out of it do you have you noticed other changes within yourself for how you live your life now versus before you went through this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i definitely think that i am more eager to surround myself with people who have the growth mindset that they want to continue to challenge themselves and get better i also use a lot more of empowering statements where i didn't realize that saying like i am anxious is disempowering but instead you could say i am on my way to getting better and that's more of a journey rather than oh i'm stuck at this state of anxiety so definitely having those skills to keep positivity in my mind has helped my progress\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it sounds like you took a lot away from the i can thrive program although it's meant for cfs and long covid and similar conditions recovery but like a lot of programs or like a lot of things that we do you learn a lot of tools that end up serving you in life past this and beyond this yeah so when you're going through the program if someone's watching it and they are thinking oh this might be a good fit for me what does it look like to actually do the program can you tell us what an average day or week looks like\n\nSPEAKER_01: sure so in the beginning you'll start to meet with jason more frequently and he will guide you through the meditating process you also have access to the resources so there's online videos that he'll send you i think one of the best parts of this program is how personable jason is so i would get text messages randomly and throughout my recovery saying i just climbed a mountain i know you can do it you're doing great and it's just great having someone who believes in you that much even though we were complete strangers and the program focuses on like you said heavy resources so we would do our coaching sessions i would watch the videos he would recommend audio books and he'd give you free copies over email and just pointing you to different authors that have similar experiences so you see that the evidence is out there that this program's working\n\nSPEAKER_00: amazing and are you do you feel fully past this now is this officially behind you\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think there's still some days where i do feel very tired but i have now these tools to fix that so obviously you know life is stressful i'm still going to have some anxious moments but i can refocus and use these tools to pass it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think that's a really good answer because i mean the question itself really you know what does it mean to be fully recovered and fully past this if anyone ever really you know because these are things that were happening in our brain and our nervous system and you know trying to send us signals and alarms and we want those things to keep working so we're going to keep going to keep having symptoms and different things in our lives to let us know what's going on i guess the great thing is is that we walk away feeling not scared of that because if something does pop up like okay i've got the tools i know what to do i can get past it yeah so for you have anything that you'd want to say to people who are watching right now who are still on their journey maybe feeling a little bit lost or hopeless or anything that you'd say to yourself if you could go back during those times\n\nSPEAKER_01: i would definitely validate what you're feeling even if you haven't found any doctors or any social support that has the same experience there are people out there who have these product fatigue syndromes whatever they're facing and this program truly could help all you need really is to be pointed to the right resources and you know just like jason he'll always tell you that you got this and it's a journey so can't just keep comparing yourself to where you've been like you're on the right path to recovery\n\nSPEAKER_00: amazing well i'm so so happy for you kelly this is incredible i'm happy you connected with jason and yeah wishing you just amazing things from here i appreciate you taking the time to tell your story i know it will mean a lot to people to hear it it's always great to see that hope on the other side and that you can turn things around quite quickly sometimes sounds like yours is you know i always say radical success is the exception not the norm so you know don't want people watching to feel discouraged if their recovery doesn't happen in two weeks i know overall it took longer than that a few months for you guys yeah it is just really encouraging to see that you can turn things around and sometimes really quite quickly so yeah thank you so much for doing this today i really appreciate it kelly yeah thank you for those of you watching looking forward to your comments as always and i will link up here if you're interested in learning more about jason mctiernan and his program i can thrive we'll put a video here to help you get a better sense of what that's all about so yeah thank you again kelly thank you to those of you watching i hope you enjoyed this video i hope you got something out of it and i hope to see you in this next one here\n\nSPEAKER_01: thanks erin\n</input_text>\nAlways use the tools/JSON

Each code should be specific and distinct without overlaps.\n\nIdentify all relevant codes in the text, provide a Name for each code in 8 to 15 words in sentence case.\n\nWrite with concise, concrete details and avoid clichés, generalizations.\n\nGive a dense Description of the code in 50 words and direct quotes from the participant for each code. \n\nIf _absolutely_ necessary quotes can consist of multiple excerpts from the text. Use ellipses to shorten quotes if needed, but avoid this if possible.

Be concise. \n\n<input_text>\nSPEAKER_00: hey guys having talked to over a hundred and seventy people already about their recovery from me cfs or long covid i've learned that while recovery definitely is possible it usually takes a while rapid recoveries are the exception but they are incredibly exciting when they do happen and today's interview is an example of just that hi everyone i'm ralan if you're new here welcome on this channel we explore recovery strategies and share real life stories every week to learn as much as we can from each other in fact these interviews are now part of a research study to discover what helps most people regain their health i'm super excited to have kelly with us today over in new york just four months after starting a recovery program she completed a ten k run and is now training for a full marathon so let's dive in and hear about her incredible journey and how she went from barely making it through the day to now running incredibly long distances kelly so great to have you here today thank you so much for being here and sharing your story yes thank you for having me so take us back you know to the beginning or before the beginning how did you how did this all start for you how did you start to notice that you something was off and you were well\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah so i typically am a very active person and i usually have a lot of energy to do different activities but there is a phase in my life where i just started to get really tired and i didn't have the motivation to go out and do as many activities and so i just started to notice things like laying in bed i would get these canker sores and just overall not feeling the best\n\nSPEAKER_00: and did you go to see a doctor what did you think was happening\n\nSPEAKER_01: i did go get my blood work done i thought maybe it was low iron or my electrolytes but my blood work came out pretty good and i thought maybe it was something mentally that was causing this\n\nSPEAKER_00: and what made you think that\n\nSPEAKER_01: just because i went to multiple doctors and they all said the same thing that everything was perfectly fine for my vitals my blood work but still i was getting lightheaded when i was standing up i didn't have as much focus during the day and the worst symptom was the mouth sores which i thought maybe had to do with me not handling my stress well\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay so it sounds like the doctors essentially sent you away with nothing and you were left to figure this out on your own so what did you do from there\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i heard about this program i can thrive and i was referred to the program by a family member and so i went to therapist before this to try to figure out some skills but none of them were as helpful as this program that i started to use\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay i've had jason on the channel before that's jason mctiernan's program correct i can thrive yeah i've interviewed a lot of people actually on the channel who have gone through his program and have recovered and interviewed him himself he's a great guy so what was it like going through the program for you and how did you find how do you think that it helped you to get past this and get where you are now\n\nSPEAKER_01: in the beginning i was a little skeptical because the program does have like a hypnosis type of effect in it where you're going through and imagining yourself at ease in a situation and trying to bring that into the future so i never really had that type of technique but once i really committed to learning the program it really made a difference and i could use all these little techniques in situations when i'm by myself such as like when i was driving in the car i get anxious and you really train your brain to think differently\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it is the whole program is based around i know a big component of it is this brain retraining piece which so many people are finding incredibly helpful with their journey had you heard of anything like this before you started doing this\n\nSPEAKER_01: i heard of going to a hypnotist which i never went to but i know some people like that i also heard of the emdr techniques for therapy so i movement desensitization and reprocessing but i never really tried his method\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just i asked because it can be a different way of thinking about healing than we usually do when our doctors tell us from what we grew up hearing about how you get well typically some sort of medication or surgery or something so to work with your brain to heal your body is a completely paradigm shift that we're in right now understanding healing and symptoms so once you started doing the program how quickly did you start to see progress\n\nSPEAKER_01: i started to see it maybe two weeks after it was pretty quick and compared to some other cases i know jason said that mine was a quicker recovery but yeah it really changed within six months i was back to feeling fully well\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow and since then you're even running ten k races can you tell us about that and what did that feel like\n\nSPEAKER_01: that was great my first ten k that i ran that year it was just motivating me to get back out there and challenge my body with physical activities right now i'm training for a full marathon with some of my friends and before i don't think i would have had the mental stamina to do that and now i just have that positive affirmations and changing the way of my mindset from fix to growth and it really has made a difference\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah going through these things does seem to transform people it's a horrible thing to go through but thankfully there's a lot of good that comes out of it do you have you noticed other changes within yourself for how you live your life now versus before you went through this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i definitely think that i am more eager to surround myself with people who have the growth mindset that they want to continue to challenge themselves and get better i also use a lot more of empowering statements where i didn't realize that saying like i am anxious is disempowering but instead you could say i am on my way to getting better and that's more of a journey rather than oh i'm stuck at this state of anxiety so definitely having those skills to keep positivity in my mind has helped my progress\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it sounds like you took a lot away from the i can thrive program although it's meant for cfs and long covid and similar conditions recovery but like a lot of programs or like a lot of things that we do you learn a lot of tools that end up serving you in life past this and beyond this yeah so when you're going through the program if someone's watching it and they are thinking oh this might be a good fit for me what does it look like to actually do the program can you tell us what an average day or week looks like\n\nSPEAKER_01: sure so in the beginning you'll start to meet with jason more frequently and he will guide you through the meditating process you also have access to the resources so there's online videos that he'll send you i think one of the best parts of this program is how personable jason is so i would get text messages randomly and throughout my recovery saying i just climbed a mountain i know you can do it you're doing great and it's just great having someone who believes in you that much even though we were complete strangers and the program focuses on like you said heavy resources so we would do our coaching sessions i would watch the videos he would recommend audio books and he'd give you free copies over email and just pointing you to different authors that have similar experiences so you see that the evidence is out there that this program's working\n\nSPEAKER_00: amazing and are you do you feel fully past this now is this officially behind you\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think there's still some days where i do feel very tired but i have now these tools to fix that so obviously you know life is stressful i'm still going to have some anxious moments but i can refocus and use these tools to pass it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think that's a really good answer because i mean the question itself really you know what does it mean to be fully recovered and fully past this if anyone ever really you know because these are things that were happening in our brain and our nervous system and you know trying to send us signals and alarms and we want those things to keep working so we're going to keep going to keep having symptoms and different things in our lives to let us know what's going on i guess the great thing is is that we walk away feeling not scared of that because if something does pop up like okay i've got the tools i know what to do i can get past it yeah so for you have anything that you'd want to say to people who are watching right now who are still on their journey maybe feeling a little bit lost or hopeless or anything that you'd say to yourself if you could go back during those times\n\nSPEAKER_01: i would definitely validate what you're feeling even if you haven't found any doctors or any social support that has the same experience there are people out there who have these product fatigue syndromes whatever they're facing and this program truly could help all you need really is to be pointed to the right resources and you know just like jason he'll always tell you that you got this and it's a journey so can't just keep comparing yourself to where you've been like you're on the right path to recovery\n\nSPEAKER_00: amazing well i'm so so happy for you kelly this is incredible i'm happy you connected with jason and yeah wishing you just amazing things from here i appreciate you taking the time to tell your story i know it will mean a lot to people to hear it it's always great to see that hope on the other side and that you can turn things around quite quickly sometimes sounds like yours is you know i always say radical success is the exception not the norm so you know don't want people watching to feel discouraged if their recovery doesn't happen in two weeks i know overall it took longer than that a few months for you guys yeah it is just really encouraging to see that you can turn things around and sometimes really quite quickly so yeah thank you so much for doing this today i really appreciate it kelly yeah thank you for those of you watching looking forward to your comments as always and i will link up here if you're interested in learning more about jason mctiernan and his program i can thrive we'll put a video here to help you get a better sense of what that's all about so yeah thank you again kelly thank you to those of you watching i hope you enjoyed this video i hope you got something out of it and i hope to see you in this next one here\n\nSPEAKER_01: thanks

in pain is anger but i thought anxiety and anger were psychological constructs it turns out it's just the sensations generated by your body when you're in fight or flight so i could most of our practice in two thousand and nineteen because i was so frustrated seeing so many people badly damaged by spine surgery i'm seeing so many people go to pain free with minimal cost no risk process\n\nSPEAKER_00: if you or someone you care about is struggling with long covid or me cfs you are in the right place and you're about to hear one of the most eye opening and information packed conversations in the chronic illness space today we're diving into what's actually driving chronic symptoms not just physically but mentally and emotionally and spoiler although it's not all in your head which we always knew it is deeply wired into your nervous system through something we'll be exploring right now called threat physiology if you're new here i'm raylan eagle and the conversations you will find here are like no other in the chronic illness space because we explore all paths to recovery if it helps people heal we talk about it the goal is to learn together and help each other find a way out and today i'm thrilled to be joined by the incredible dr david hanscom he spent over thirty years as a complex spine surgeon until he realized he had to walk away from the operating room to help people truly heal from chronic pain and his own fifteen year journey with pain and many other symptoms led him to an unexpected discovery anxiety looping thoughts and unconscious stress patterns were actually at the root and once he addressed those he finally fully recovered and now he teaches how to shift from threat to safety physiology interrupt repetitive unwanted thoughts and work with the unconscious brain where most pain actually begins and according to him and so many other respected professionals in this field this approach works not just for chronic pain but also for anxiety depression and yes even me cfs and long covid so if you're stuck in fear loops if your body feels like it's always on high alert or if you're just exhausted from being told that there's nothing wrong with you when you know that something is my heart goes out to you and this conversation is absolutely for you so let's dive in dr hanscom wonderful to have you here thanks for doing this yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: thank you i'm excited to be here\n\nSPEAKER_00: oh my goodness such a vast amount of knowledge and experience you have on this topic i can't wait to get into all of this i'm sure people would love to hear a little bit before we get into the details of all of this just your journey how did you end up doing this work that you were doing what's your experience been leading up to today\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i'll try to keep this story relatively short but basically practice complex deformity surgery in seattle washington for about thirty two years and about four years four years into my practice around nine hundred ninety i was in seattle right across the five twenty bridge and at the time you know i was in my practice i was a young gun you know just going after it hard and i didn't didn't even know what the word anxiety was you know become a major spice or by having an anxiety and also in the five twenty bridge in seattle i had a panic attack what is this and i look it up i didn't know what it was and you know it's basically just regulated nervous system it's an ultimate anxiety reaction and from that point on for the next thirteen or fourteen years i cannot come out of this hole so i develop seventeen different symptoms of migraine headaches itching scalp skin rashes back pain neck pain can sleep ring in my ears and my whole nervous system sort of fell apart but nobody could tell me what was going on so part of it i went to counseling for like thirteen years psychotherapy trying to figure this out and things got even worse and it wasn't till two thousand two thousand and three things get extremely bad that it sounds odd but sort of gave up fighting i didn't know what else to do and inadvertently as you're not certain turned out sort of to be the answer because we're eventually learned that with the brain be so neuroplastic whatever you're fighting and trying to fix actually becomes reinforced thirteen psychotherapy which actually reinforcing the pain circuits not help them so bottom line is i q out of my also symptoms around two thousand and four and i've been pretty much symptom free for over twenty years and i never thought this past never thought this was possible and i came i went into it by accident i came out of play accident it to me about twenty years to figure out what happened the last five years who form a scientific international study group that she goes into the science of chronic illness and now i actually know it figured it out has been about a thirty five year quest to figure out what happened to me that day on the bridge\n\nSPEAKER_00: and from all of your learning from what happened to you how does this tie into your work as the spinal surgery and how you then proceeded to approach treating patients\n\nSPEAKER_01: was starting out interim medicine so he's to be has sort of a whole person approach right from the beginning so i always see a piece a few times before surgery or to make sure they get physical therapy medications etc still a pretty aggressive surgeon but a lot of the surgeries weren't working very well so seattle at the time i was there between run nineteen eighty six to nine hundred ninety five was doing nine times the rate of spine fusion per capita as any place else in the country and so i was part of that team i was enthusiastic i feel guilty if i cannot find a reason to do surgery and i started to think what i did but basically turns out we are operating on normally aging spines the success rate of doing a spine fusion back pain is about twenty percent is a big operation and i thought it was like ninety percent but i knew my results were as good as i wanted to one of them to be and my got mine up to about forty five percent but it was because of the surgery is because of the rehab so ninety ninety three in that paper came out i just quit doing surgery for back pain but i didn't know what to do so meantime i spiral into this deep hole of chronic pain and multiple symptoms and so i just sort of did the best i could not operate in nine hundred ninety nine i moved to sunny idaho in a private practice sole practice and i didn't have any resources so i started doing everything by myself and i knew that there are some tools that work in long story short i took a surgeon's approach to non operative care surgeons if you address sleep is number one people weren't sleeping we found out that lack of sleep out of study in israel so that lack of sleep actually causes chronicle back pain not the way around sure goes interesting so hard but the data also showed only five percent of surgeons were five in a physicians were actually addressing sleep so i started doing that i handed a little book called feeling good but david burns which is cognitive behavioral therapy i did have a psychologist and then david started to do some expressive writing so we started that people started getting better always to get physical therapy and rehab so that was in place i was still as medications and then would you not really in a clear way was life outlook so is jumping ahead twenty years it turned out that the biggest factor keeping people in pain is anger but i thought anxiety and anger were psychological construct in turns out it's just the sensations generated by your body when you're in fight or flight so you feel anxious your body says danger show you your fight or flight response starting if you can't solve the danger you can more a fight or flight response and you become angry so turned out anger and anxiety are physiological survival responses that we have no control over zero in a for my bruce lipton who is the author of the book biology believe put out really clearly we have zero control out of anxiety and anger and we now call it threat physiology and so anxiety is active physiology anger is hyperactivity through physiology and the problem with physiology your entire system fires up so your neurotransmitters in the brain go from calming to start a tory your stress hormones of course kick in place there's a little molecule in the bottle called cytokines as you all know little molecules that go from such from cell to cell there's inflammatory ones in profile tory ones in under fight or flight your entire immune system lights up and then cortisol drains fuel out of your body it's been known for fifty years that chronic stress breaks down the body i e chronic fighter flight so any athlete has to train then rest in order to regenerate if you're in constant stress fight or flight your body breaks down it turns out that every chronic disease with few exceptions are related to chronic stress that's mental and physical diseases so turned out the anxiety depression bipolar o c d and schizophrenia are basically metabolic inflammatory disorders really so critical is that this physiological response is about you know half a million times stronger than your conscious brain so your conscious brain unconscious brain processes about eleven million bits of information per second take us how much your process your conscious brain processes\n\nSPEAKER_00: i couldn't begin to imagine\n\nSPEAKER_01: forty so what were happening when you're in fight or flight your highest thinking party or brain the neocortex doesn't work so when you're running from a tiger you know thinking about philosophy in the human cortex is so big compared to other mammals that when the blood supply drops down in that part of the brain it really drops down and your thinking centers are markedly compromised and you're just reacting you're not really thinking and so says so much stronger than your conscious brain will use conscious control or conscious interventions or try to counteract that it's a mismatch you cannot do it\n\nSPEAKER_00: this is fascinating i am so excited to hear you explaining all of this is so validating or us going through this to hear this coming from a physician from a surgeon from you know medical a scientific perspective because it can all sound a little bit that oh you're in all this pain you're you have a world of symptoms and you have to look at your emotions and you know this is your path out of this so i'm wondering how many other doctors in your experience are aware of this approach to healing in the in the latest science and embrace it and use it\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i would say some i see very few surgeons i would say very very few surgeons and i was helping hundreds of patients literally go to pain free so my symptoms are gone and i fight out the science behind this and so i translated it into a book and a website no of course where people systematically go through learn the tools to calm the physiology and reroute it reroute the nervous system in the pain results and it happens hundreds and hundreds of times so i'm watching people being badly damaged by spine surgery with very expensive long term i mean really devastating results from best i surgery i was a guy who was trying to clean up the mess and it wasn't solvable most the time so i get somebody before they had any surgery at all it was just magical i can tell you some stories in a second but the bottom line is that's very self directed and i don't think as you go too much in the details of the course now because the idea is it's about learning skills so what's evolved in the last couple years is that the body knows how to heal you know sort of a trice saying but it's really true is in threat physiology your body breaks down right it was if you sustain it really breaks down and then weight lifters lifting weight he or she has to rest for the most muscles to go back up there was overtraining actually breaks your body down they think if your body's in constant fight or flight your body's going to break down so what happens is always through physiology again physiology is how the body functions in their city physiology with body rest regeneration heals so some ratio of enough safety compared to threat the body heals itself so the healing that occurs is far beyond what i can do is far beyond a self help process and not only do people go to pain free usually all the symptoms resolve and they thrive in a little possible that happens over in over and over again so i could most of practice in two thousand and nineteen because so frustrated seeing so many people badly damaged by spice or three and seen so many people go to pain free with minimal cost no risk self directed process you do not need a pain clinic to do this i said i had to quit so that was in two thousand nineteen i have not made nearly as much progress as i thought it would but all the medical fish is flat out digging in his heels that's a long answer to that question there is not buying it and the thing they ranch for a second we learn this in college actually learns in high school is the physiology class right temperature blood pressure heart rate all these things are in physiology class in college a little bit more in medical school we learned about the human body at a very very deep level and the physiology is where it happens because the body functions with physiology becomes ill when it dysfunctions so we're focused on structure and so the problem is we're just called medically unexplained symptoms by chance m u s sounds familiar well started out in two thousand and two in the failure practice literature you say well we know you've all these symptoms we kind of we can't find a source we call it medically unexplained symptoms was it terrible diagnosis because people give up hope ok they know it's going on there does the idea of the diagnosis was to acknowledge the fact that you hurt which is a start and we nothing we can do but can help you cope with it so that's wrong if we look at the physiology of stress and again stress is the problem coming in going to fight or flight because of stresses and threats you look at this is physiology of sustained stress everything is explained every single symptom i had is gone how can that be every cell in the body's bath in this chemical environment you know different organ systems have different functions so i migraine headaches they're gone but what happens is that the blood vessels of the brain get inflamed transmitters neurotransmitters are off and when you really regulate your physiology back to safety that goes away my ears were ringing tinnitus for many many years twenty five years i thought from construction work days and i do have some hearing loss it's gone is a renda symptom sounds sort of mild but the chronic really bothers you it's gone and the reason for that again i can theorize on it but it's gone lots of people in my course have had the tennis disappear but again fight or flight your nervous self has inflammatory cells your brain your brain itself is inflate so it takes less stress to set off this the sensations than the nerve connection in your body doubles so you have a hyperactive ear and receptive system in your ears ring my feet would burn like crazy especially at night that's gone skin rashes would pop up over my body that's gone and back pain neck pain that's gone so you say well how can that be physiology covers every cell in the body and if you come physiology all the symptoms disappear one person twenty four symptoms gone another gentleman had twenty surgeries and twenty nine surgeries in twenty years and his suffered it was just a huge mess of his life and he started work with my stuff about ten years ago and in about a year who pain free and ten years later he's living the best life of his entire life that's after twenty eight surgery there's two parts to healing one of them is to learn to your survival physiology is keeping you alive it's a gift so anxiety anger are gifts i mean how you survive without anger and anxiety we would not so you learn to separate your identity from these stress reactions is we take your identity in we take your stress reaction which are intended to be very unpleasant you take them personally you don't feel good and a lot of mental energy trying to compensate for this bad feelings was supposed to be bad so as you separate denny from the stress reactions and say look just take a thermometer visually on the other on the opposite wall and we feel really anxious angry and frustrated just visualize how high this morris going in you should use the tools to drop it down and so that's one part of it the other half is nurturing joy so again you can nurture joy if you're fighting stress not possible you can think you are in trying to distract yourself but it's such a mismatch it never works but if you try to run your pain stress physiology yes you reinforce it so we call it self induced deep healing as if you train your brain is a trained learned skills non positive thinking by the way which is another disaster but you sort of train your brain to be less reactive to the pain issue training to be less reactive is when you fight it you really reinforce the circuits we talk about it he reinforces circuits so you learn a common physiology and then when you're on then you do what you want to do so the healing actually occurs as you start living your life on your terms not by fighting the pain so i have little saying is quit fighting darkness and just turn on the light so it's a bit more complicated that but not much and i'll just be one example to one model here so we can maybe go on the the mental part of the conversation as far as these repetitive thought patterns but you know we came up with a model called dynamic healing so every living creature has sensory sceptors that takes input from the environment whatever environment that is you have the century input touch sound sight feel all these different sensations so those come into your nervous system and so you have your input your nervous system which processes all this and you have your output which is the physiology either threat or safety so there's ways of process your stresses differently so they have less impact on your nervous system there's ways of making nervous system going from hyper reactive to call and there is a physiology there's things you can dress lee learn the physiology on the input side of the good the goal is just more safety physiology so all these interventions come towards one goal so it's never one intervention solves a problem is a combination of just a life using different tools in your times of the day to calm down your physiology so for instance which you want to sample is if you're my office and you have chronic pain as you look when you walk in the office you'll never discuss your pain ever with anybody and because what's as input was input doing your physiology right so it is a bit deeper than there is just your physiology i'm sure never discuss your pain or discussion medical care no complaining no criticism giving unasked for advice and no gossip because what's it doing to your physiology right so that's one of the basic cardinal rules are simply no negativity and often we sure in some workshops back east those were a carnival rolls and it takes about six weeks actually slow that down because we all like to complain this is where we are and it's for hard especially the gossip part of people used to gossiping but it again fires a breath of physiology especially when you're in pain you are complaining about the doctors medical system there's illnesses you complain about when you're in pain and the are legitimate complaint but you want you do you want your brain on the problem or do you want to solution so this one example how we work on input for output for instance you probably have done this a lot with your clients where you do breath work like slow breathing stimulus was called the biggest nerve which is anti inflammatory or rubbing your forehead stimulates the fifth cranial nerve i'm sure the same fifth grain or in the forehead i actually took that little tool for my cat so i can call my cat down really quickly by rubbing her forehead so also sound there's some pitches of music that really stimulate the biggest nerve and actually causing to calm down issue lower the physiology is for is the nervous system itself you make it more resilient was sleep is number one you have to sleep diet you know to find her diet and exercise are the three big ones as far as the nervous system so your sister be call or hyperactive and sometimes you come from an abusive environment or system to be feel safe so i taking a feral cat and try to calm it down you can't talk to it you said to teach it how to feel safe so that's where the dynamic healing you have your input or stresses your nervous system or copy skills you have your physiology the output and we have threat physiology then you have symptoms so the root cause the root cause of illness is interaction between your stresses in your coping skills so we're treating only the symptoms so the root causes and we close being address so it's like trying to put on an oil well fire with a garden hose you know the fuel keeps coming up and you've got to go to the root cause by dealing with so when we teach people to learn these tools about ten or fifteen minutes a day that's it we try to really really learn about pain or really solve the problem you're actually reinforcing the pain here's learning tools that use every day all day long you should not be work because one of the end to those anxiety is play is you think sort of playful curious attitude towards it that really comes of the physiology that's whole different topic they were the bottom line is that in a killing motor you change the input you increase your nervous system learn to lower the threat physiology then the symptoms resolve themselves i covered a lot of ground there\n\nSPEAKER_00: i was just thinking i think you've covered everything that i've been working to cover on this channel since it started we might just shut down the channel after today this is i think a mic drop moment\n\nSPEAKER_00: you've explained it so incredibly well and light bulbs are just going off all over the place as even thinking with my own journey for my first couple of years i was really laid out and really symptomatic and then i decided for a year that i was going to stop trying to fix myself because i didn't know what else to do and i wasn't going to talk about it i made a rule because i was tired of it being my whole identity and it was interesting it wasn't the whole fix but in that year just by stop trying to fix it and never talking about it again i started to feel better\n\nSPEAKER_00: one of a zillion little you know light bulb moments that were going off for me as you're talking about i think though i mean preaching to the choir here as well as to you know a lot of the people that watch this channel are pretty right up and up to speed on the science behind this but still understandably many have not been given this information or are just hearing it for the first time and it sounds a little bit off because i still hear every day from people i have all these symptoms i'm really struggling to believe that i'm going to be able to get rid of them all without surgery or medication so what was you estimate what percentage of chronic debilitating symptoms are alleviated with surgery or medication\n\nSPEAKER_01: memory treating symptoms so surgery symptom and so my one pain of the body so to me a long time to figure this out so let's take back pain there is not operation should ever be done with back pain ever works the reason for that is first of all the same acute lumbar strain you strain your back and about half of people by the way this developing backstrain it goes on to be chronic so the m r i scans what happens there's a pain center in the brain lights up back pain in about six or twelve months actually shifts to the emotional center the same pain but a different driver is a definition of chronic pain is a embedded memory that becomes connected to more and more life experiences and the memory cannot be erased and it cannot these pain circuits are absolutely permanent is similar to phantom limb pain or leg is cut off here why is the pain still there the structures gone in so the brain if you think about this carefully every living creature to memorize everything all the time otherwise we don't stay alive you know when across the street we know we're not looking to the sun we know how to stay safe but your brain's taking it in if mission every second so which is really information it just ignores it because it's safe so the new comes up you have to analyze it but your brain memorizes everything but especially pain and so it sounds discouraging but he is the more you try to fight it and solve it the more you reinforce it so you really are going to get rid of these pain circuits you can walk through them you walk past them you can transcend but you can't fight them and so what you're doing is you learn to separate yourself from your pain in the first thing that happens by the way with mental pain and physical pain is that you change your relationship to the pain is the pain she or you're here\n\nSPEAKER_01: as you start getting on with your life the way you want to your terms that's the solution it's really is so from neuroplasticity standpoint by the way neuroplasticity i'm sure knows it we do not i didn't know this medical school i'm sure we even knew it back in medical school but your brain changes by the second we thought that the brain was static in sort of lost cells as you get older and it changes every millisecond so even right now both of our brains have changed and so what you're doing you're trying to direct the brain to change the direction she want and that's why if you start living life that you want and you quit fighting the old one that part of your old brain starts atrophy so the circuit is still there they can be triggered any time but they really attribute the point where they just don't bother anymore so it's consistent one example right now again i don't know if the eyes comprehensive depression o c d bipolar his metabolic inflammatory disorders they're not psychological so in zari is the term we use when you're fight or flight so it just describes humans have this description for fight or flight who calls it just a descriptive term is not a psychological diagnosis she learned to live with it be with it i don't like to embrace it but you do embrace it because it's part of keep you alive he just go on your way\n\nSPEAKER_00: we talk a lot here on the channel about the conscious brain and unconscious brain so what is the relationship between those two and why is it important to understand that when it comes to chronic conditions\n\nSPEAKER_01: well chronic disease is a state and dr navio at mitochondrial has shown that you have chronic illness is motor connect they don't heal she actually shift that state before you actually can move forward if you use an acute interventions for economic problem it doesn't work so what you're doing is learn how to calm down physiology and then move forward you know so the question was exactly what again\n\nSPEAKER_00: understand it we talk about some things happened in our unconscious brain and other things we happen in our conscious brain and we need to bring things from the unconscious to the conscious there i just i think it gets a bit confusing for people understanding the relationship between the two and you know how this relates to their symptoms and their recovery\n\nSPEAKER_01: so the unconscious brain keeps you alive we do not need conscious brain to stay alive so we use conscious brain you have to be careful because you know animals have consciousness also right our animals look at things analyzing decisions but they don't have thoughts they don't have language to put meaning to it so they still respond if we do not have a new cortex we still stay alive chimpanzees have ninety nine point nine percent of the d n a we do you have quite a bit of intellectual capacity but they don't have this huge neocortex so remember the unconscious brain is eleven million bits of your patient per second the conscious brain is forty that's it so you can't control it and so it's like trying to drag stir with handbrakes dr work with a conscious brain does it gives you the steering wheel you can steer and direct it wherever you want so your conscious brain will react to whatever you put into it again if you consciously decide to complain to be negative that's what's going to happen your conscious brain is respond to what you put into it so it's a forty bits of information per second eleven million you decide what you want to load into this thing if you're put loaded negative you have a massive survival reaction and so the other thing is that this is been also eight hundred which i'm really disturbed about his house on a couple weeks ago but if you see somebody dangerous walking across the street your body actually responds first before you have thoughts it's the actually physiology first so it's about a one to ten second delay your body automatically reacted by the time you think about it so let's have a thoughts for second new book on repetitive i wanted thoughts and so what i learned in my own experience is i have full blown obsessive compulsive disorder which is marked by really extreme intrusive thoughts and most people don't have that but just by definition the way the brain works and this is where i think humanity's going to come up this different solution for this is that your threat physiology creates unpleasant thought because what happens you're the conscious brain is interpreted the sensations made by your unconscious nervous system we call it intraception so if you're buying fight or flight your conscious brain gives different meanings to these sensations you know as an in the same or a negative words you know sad shame embarrass all these different things are meanings we give to a physiology so the way your brain is working is that your your physiology creates the unpleasant thoughts then the thoughts themselves become input that actually strikes up the physiology this very bi directional and so after a while with repetition the thoughts become embedded in different triggers always fire the physiology vice versa so if you're anxious frustrated for any reason you're from negative thoughts then the negative thoughts can also become their own input so this one part is by directional that's very unique to humans so we're through unwanted thoughts or rumination why ninety five percent people ninety five percent of people have these things about seventy percent of people have a lot of destruction lifestyle i had extreme form showing about two or three percent population of extreme intrusive thoughts really negative really negative with all the physical symptoms i had the two worst parts my deal were these repetitive thought patterns they were just horrible so by the way is also direct relationship between thoughts and suicide actually attempted suicide miss whole thing and what drove me to that was the thoughts they just would not stop so i noticed over the years of people's pain would disappear their anxiety would drop and these thought patterns spinning away so forcefully my experience they actually disappeared they're gone but i could figure out why and so you have to understand is that there's a four part process when these thoughts so the miracle i just start with is that of a hornet's nest where the nest river is your system or your brain in the horse or your thoughts you know somebody shakes the nest the hornets are pretty unhappy is what we're doing right side fighting these hornets which is making them more angry the real interest which shaking the nest so the four parts of solving this pattern says number one separate from the thoughts that's where my friend is conducted behavior therapy comes into play if you heard six size call expressive writing if you work with that much so that separates you from the thoughts not solving them to say thought separation process and then the nervous system so the first of a separate from your thoughts calm physiology the third part destroy i mean dissolve your ego and the fourth partner plasticity so thought separations of first part where you learn to express and look at him mindfulness is the same thing you simply the thoughts are here you're here in common physiology is a stylish healing model we change the input the nervous system the output and what you're doing is mostly around anger so people are angry about a lot of things they always have been particular this day and age with a lot of sensory input we're overwhelmed or frustrated we feel trapped and when you're angry your nervous system is really fired up so there's a bunch of tools i call it anger processing to calm things down is sort of beyond the scope of this discussion but calm physiology does actually critical so physiology drives the thoughts in medicine we're not addressing the physiology so do it in the summer of carnita processes to deal with these thoughts in not even the root cause at all the third part which made you know just go for this discussion that we develop an ego for a couple reasons one of them is our stress physiology is unpleasant it's just feel bad so we develop this story about ourselves to feel better about ourselves second of all we're mostly programmed by negativity right\n\nSPEAKER_01: we're raised by criticism do this do this should do this shouldn't do that so we're sort of programmed through our lifetime with negativity so we develop our own internal story about ourselves to feel better and then the third reason is we're competitive species like every other creature so we want to look good so we spend a lot of time building up this appearance to other people but also to ourselves to look good it takes a lot of mental energy to do that so on top of that we suppress negativity so the suppressed thoughts emotion really fire up this whole process or ruts and then it develops into mental what's called mental rigidity which is cemented in my anger is this really fixed view of yourself it's not solvable that's where conspiracy theories come into a big play with these thoughts about life in general that this and this so rigid thinking is a huge block to healing is a huge block to treatment you get a certain mindset and it's not so it's not changeable so that's the challenge we deal with now is if you're open to actually engaging people heal but the key issue is people don't believe it you mentioned earlier well what if you talk about this people don't buy into it well it's a problem so i ask people don't believe me so when you leave this podcast or tv show don't believe anything i said the key is connect to what's in there which is skepticism so i said you don't have to believe anything and david hanscom or the process or whatever it is believe that your body knows how to heal so connecting with what is is a huge factor so connect with your skepticism is actually the starting point you start doing the work now letting your brain start to change then the fourth part where the healing actually occurs we talked about this before you separate from your physiology over here because you nurture joy good food good wine good friends your brain develops that direction that's the definitive healing it's not by fixing the negative side it's by nurturing the good side so with these thought patterns you got your thought separation call the physiology the driving force the third thing which has to happen relatively quickly is kill your ego you don't need it you understand your three physiologies over here you're not taking it personally you don't need an ego it's a ways to think about it so think how much time we spend with me being king of this how much time we spend build up an appearance that we think is okay so that takes mental energy that my cat doesn't spend time with so you know she just gets what she wants anyway so she doesn't need an ego\n\nSPEAKER_00: so that goes so i'm thinking about the people listening watching and i think there's a tendency for people to think i'm somehow going to be the one person that this doesn't apply to so for people who learn what this is about who implement strategies who follow this course of moving forward i mean what percentage of people would you estimate that this could be beneficial for for people with these chronic symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i'll tell you that i don't know all i know that depends on this repetition so it depends how committed you are to learning the skills the focus is on the skills not believing so usually calm your physiology and let your body heal the hardest part of this project by far is people can't help but try to fix themselves and when you do that of course your attention's on the problem so we learn to be with the problem and then move a different direction so if people engage is a high percentage heal but it may take a week usually obviously being three to six months of repetition is a key issue here and it takes a while to learn how to play the piano learn how to become a professional at anything and people might say well i don't want to become a professional oh really i mean you basically become a professional at life skills so we're not being the highest level professional learn how to rig your physiology so i'll just give you one example i mean i have a lot of people in there the thought patterns are a little bit something i'm learning i mean it's really tough to break through these thought patterns as far as the pain and anxiety that can drop down relatively quickly i'm on a learning curve as far as the thought patterns but one gentleman who i saw a couple months ago he's a friend of a friend now i'm not in clinical practice so i can give guidance so he was having surgery recommended a normal spine who's like a long spine fusion international he was suicidally depressed so the data has shown forever again the whole process evolved of just just by trying to follow the research about what we're supposed to do so none of this is something i made up or invented or some magic formula is just following the science so the data even if i didn't know any of those clear back forty years ago you don't operate on people that are suicidally depressed you just don't do that well that's being done all the time now and so that operation in that circumstance would have put him in and this is what it would show my practice so it started the process that i'm working on about six weeks ago i talked to a couple days ago his mood is way better depression is lifted he's not suicidal the pain is still there but he doesn't react so much which is always the first thing with pain that is there doesn't bother you as much eventually as you keep going different direction informing new circuits in your brain those new circuits don't have pain so people do go to pain free and it's better repetition and learning tools but again we call it deep self induced healing if you allow your body be a state of physiology your body heals itself so this might be confusing but i'm going to try anyway there's a concept of self help versus deep healing so self help helps symptoms and if you contribute contributed to healing but the idea of self help is i want to learn enough tools i want to be really good about processing pain because i want less pain the pain of the show so inadvertently self help processes tend to reinforce chronic pain so deep healing is learning to not react to the pain be with the pain and then go a different direction so letting go the fixing process is really challenging that's probably the biggest step is letting go\n\nSPEAKER_00: this is incredible i'm just thinking this is a lot of information for people watching listening so if you're feeling like i think maybe i retained ten percent of that don't worry watch it again i'm already thinking i'm going to have to go back and replay this and i'm wondering what resources what information what do you have available for people who want to learn more about this from you and get some support on their journey\n\nSPEAKER_01: so all my resources are on my website back in control com one word and then on the front page there there's a lot of resources we put up some books which really just nice summaries of the situation just to really a simple start to it i have a book back in control a surgery on a chronic pain and then i have a course called the doc journey direct your own care journey it's a computer based course and i recommend people spend maybe about ten or twenty minutes a day on it that's it it shouldn't be work should be curiosity what's going on look at it as just learning skills it's very self directed then i coach twice a week and tuesdays and thursdays at noon on a zoom call and so the coaching myself is not effective if you add the coaching to the course is very effective and so then i have all sorts of videos and blogs and probably too much stuff on the website but the core between the flip books the course the coaching is sort of in the book back in control get you started on what you're going to do incredible yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay well make sure to have that all linked in the video description so people could check it out because you have hit the nail on the head for that all the key things that the experts that i bring on this channel talk about and explained it just also concisely so for people watching listening to yourself a favor take a moment look at some of those links because you know he's got the experience the knowledge and clearly a wonderful person so some really great resources there to make use of on your journey and i'm also going to link if you're watching this and this is resonating i did another interview with dr howard schubner you might be aware of so i'll link that up on the screen as well if people want to check that out it's just really incredible and really validating to have so many knowledgeable physicians coming forward and speaking about this and just validating the experiences of people going through this because for many years so many of us felt lost and or told it was all in our head or we were just being lazy or maybe making it up so this is impact just not only the validation but also tools a path forward you can get better\n\nSPEAKER_01: howard schumer is a good friend of mine he's my mentor oh and we play golf together we stay each other's houses and stuff so he's wonderful he's very academic he keeps doing the research on it and he's really really wonderful\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah he i've only interviewed him the one time but i just thought the world of him and he is another one who is just really changing so many people's lives it's it's incredible the work that people like yourself and him are doing thank you so much for being here i really appreciate this every sentence of this has been gold truly valuable i really appreciate it dr\n\nSPEAKER_01: thank you i really enjoyed our time\n\nSPEAKER_00: thanks to everyone for watching and listening and hope to see you in this next also incredibly information packed interview with dr howard schieffner\n</input_text>\nAlways use the tools/JSON

in pain is anger but i thought anxiety and anger were psychological constructs it turns out it's just the sensations generated by your body when you're in fight or flight so i could most of our practice in two thousand and nineteen because i was so frustrated seeing so many people badly damaged by spine surgery i'm seeing so many people go to pain free with minimal cost no risk process\n\nSPEAKER_00: if you or someone you care about is struggling with long covid or me cfs you are in the right place and you're about to hear one of the most eye opening and information packed conversations in the chronic illness space today we're diving into what's actually driving chronic symptoms not just physically but mentally and emotionally and spoiler although it's not all in your head which we always knew it is deeply wired into your nervous system through something we'll be exploring right now called threat physiology if you're new here i'm raylan eagle and the conversations you will find here are like no other in the chronic illness space because we explore all paths to recovery if it helps people heal we talk about it the goal is to learn together and help each other find a way out and today i'm thrilled to be joined by the incredible dr david hanscom he spent over thirty years as a complex spine surgeon until he realized he had to walk away from the operating room to help people truly heal from chronic pain and his own fifteen year journey with pain and many other symptoms led him to an unexpected discovery anxiety looping thoughts and unconscious stress patterns were actually at the root and once he addressed those he finally fully recovered and now he teaches how to shift from threat to safety physiology interrupt repetitive unwanted thoughts and work with the unconscious brain where most pain actually begins and according to him and so many other respected professionals in this field this approach works not just for chronic pain but also for anxiety depression and yes even me cfs and long covid so if you're stuck in fear loops if your body feels like it's always on high alert or if you're just exhausted from being told that there's nothing wrong with you when you know that something is my heart goes out to you and this conversation is absolutely for you so let's dive in dr hanscom wonderful to have you here thanks for doing this yeah\n\nSPEAKER_01: thank you i'm excited to be here\n\nSPEAKER_00: oh my goodness such a vast amount of knowledge and experience you have on this topic i can't wait to get into all of this i'm sure people would love to hear a little bit before we get into the details of all of this just your journey how did you end up doing this work that you were doing what's your experience been leading up to today\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i'll try to keep this story relatively short but basically practice complex deformity surgery in seattle washington for about thirty two years and about four years four years into my practice around nine hundred ninety i was in seattle right across the five twenty bridge and at the time you know i was in my practice i was a young gun you know just going after it hard and i didn't didn't even know what the word anxiety was you know become a major spice or by having an anxiety and also in the five twenty bridge in seattle i had a panic attack what is this and i look it up i didn't know what it was and you know it's basically just regulated nervous system it's an ultimate anxiety reaction and from that point on for the next thirteen or fourteen years i cannot come out of this hole so i develop seventeen different symptoms of migraine headaches itching scalp skin rashes back pain neck pain can sleep ring in my ears and my whole nervous system sort of fell apart but nobody could tell me what was going on so part of it i went to counseling for like thirteen years psychotherapy trying to figure this out and things got even worse and it wasn't till two thousand two thousand and three things get extremely bad that it sounds odd but sort of gave up fighting i didn't know what else to do and inadvertently as you're not certain turned out sort of to be the answer because we're eventually learned that with the brain be so neuroplastic whatever you're fighting and trying to fix actually becomes reinforced thirteen psychotherapy which actually reinforcing the pain circuits not help them so bottom line is i q out of my also symptoms around two thousand and four and i've been pretty much symptom free for over twenty years and i never thought this past never thought this was possible and i came i went into it by accident i came out of play accident it to me about twenty years to figure out what happened the last five years who form a scientific international study group that she goes into the science of chronic illness and now i actually know it figured it out has been about a thirty five year quest to figure out what happened to me that day on the bridge\n\nSPEAKER_00: and from all of your learning from what happened to you how does this tie into your work as the spinal surgery and how you then proceeded to approach treating patients\n\nSPEAKER_01: was starting out interim medicine so he's to be has sort of a whole person approach right from the beginning so i always see a piece a few times before surgery or to make sure they get physical therapy medications etc still a pretty aggressive surgeon but a lot of the surgeries weren't working very well so seattle at the time i was there between run nineteen eighty six to nine hundred ninety five was doing nine times the rate of spine fusion per capita as any place else in the country and so i was part of that team i was enthusiastic i feel guilty if i cannot find a reason to do surgery and i started to think what i did but basically turns out we are operating on normally aging spines the success rate of doing a spine fusion back pain is about twenty percent is a big operation and i thought it was like ninety percent but i knew my results were as good as i wanted to one of them to be and my got mine up to about forty five percent but it was because of the surgery is because of the rehab so ninety ninety three in that paper came out i just quit doing surgery for back pain but i didn't know what to do so meantime i spiral into this deep hole of chronic pain and multiple symptoms and so i just sort of did the best i could not operate in nine hundred ninety nine i moved to sunny idaho in a private practice sole practice and i didn't have any resources so i started doing everything by myself and i knew that there are some tools that work in long story short i took a surgeon's approach to non operative care surgeons if you address sleep is number one people weren't sleeping we found out that lack of sleep out of study in israel so that lack of sleep actually causes chronicle back pain not the way around sure goes interesting so hard but the data also showed only five percent of surgeons were five in a physicians were actually addressing sleep so i started doing that i handed a little book called feeling good but david burns which is cognitive behavioral therapy i did have a psychologist and then david started to do some expressive writing so we started that people started getting better always to get physical therapy and rehab so that was in place i was still as medications and then would you not really in a clear way was life outlook so is jumping ahead twenty years it turned out that the biggest factor keeping people in pain is anger but i thought anxiety and anger were psychological construct in turns out it's just the sensations generated by your body when you're in fight or flight so you feel anxious your body says danger show you your fight or flight response starting if you can't solve the danger you can more a fight or flight response and you become angry so turned out anger and anxiety are physiological survival responses that we have no control over zero in a for my bruce lipton who is the author of the book biology believe put out really clearly we have zero control out of anxiety and anger and we now call it threat physiology and so anxiety is active physiology anger is hyperactivity through physiology and the problem with physiology your entire system fires up so your neurotransmitters in the brain go from calming to start a tory your stress hormones of course kick in place there's a little molecule in the bottle called cytokines as you all know little molecules that go from such from cell to cell there's inflammatory ones in profile tory ones in under fight or flight your entire immune system lights up and then cortisol drains fuel out of your body it's been known for fifty years that chronic stress breaks down the body i e chronic fighter flight so any athlete has to train then rest in order to regenerate if you're in constant stress fight or flight your body breaks down it turns out that every chronic disease with few exceptions are related to chronic stress that's mental and physical diseases so turned out the anxiety depression bipolar o c d and schizophrenia are basically metabolic inflammatory disorders really so critical is that this physiological response is about you know half a million times stronger than your conscious brain so your conscious brain unconscious brain processes about eleven million bits of information per second take us how much your process your conscious brain processes\n\nSPEAKER_00: i couldn't begin to imagine\n\nSPEAKER_01: forty so what were happening when you're in fight or flight your highest thinking party or brain the neocortex doesn't work so when you're running from a tiger you know thinking about philosophy in the human cortex is so big compared to other mammals that when the blood supply drops down in that part of the brain it really drops down and your thinking centers are markedly compromised and you're just reacting you're not really thinking and so says so much stronger than your conscious brain will use conscious control or conscious interventions or try to counteract that it's a mismatch you cannot do it\n\nSPEAKER_00: this is fascinating i am so excited to hear you explaining all of this is so validating or us going through this to hear this coming from a physician from a surgeon from you know medical a scientific perspective because it can all sound a little bit that oh you're in all this pain you're you have a world of symptoms and you have to look at your emotions and you know this is your path out of this so i'm wondering how many other doctors in your experience are aware of this approach to healing in the in the latest science and embrace it and use it\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i would say some i see very few surgeons i would say very very few surgeons and i was helping hundreds of patients literally go to pain free so my symptoms are gone and i fight out the science behind this and so i translated it into a book and a website no of course where people systematically go through learn the tools to calm the physiology and reroute it reroute the nervous system in the pain results and it happens hundreds and hundreds of times so i'm watching people being badly damaged by spine surgery with very expensive long term i mean really devastating results from best i surgery i was a guy who was trying to clean up the mess and it wasn't solvable most the time so i get somebody before they had any surgery at all it was just magical i can tell you some stories in a second but the bottom line is that's very self directed and i don't think as you go too much in the details of the course now because the idea is it's about learning skills so what's evolved in the last couple years is that the body knows how to heal you know sort of a trice saying but it's really true is in threat physiology your body breaks down right it was if you sustain it really breaks down and then weight lifters lifting weight he or she has to rest for the most muscles to go back up there was overtraining actually breaks your body down they think if your body's in constant fight or flight your body's going to break down so what happens is always through physiology again physiology is how the body functions in their city physiology with body rest regeneration heals so some ratio of enough safety compared to threat the body heals itself so the healing that occurs is far beyond what i can do is far beyond a self help process and not only do people go to pain free usually all the symptoms resolve and they thrive in a little possible that happens over in over and over again so i could most of practice in two thousand and nineteen because so frustrated seeing so many people badly damaged by spice or three and seen so many people go to pain free with minimal cost no risk self directed process you do not need a pain clinic to do this i said i had to quit so that was in two thousand nineteen i have not made nearly as much progress as i thought it would but all the medical fish is flat out digging in his heels that's a long answer to that question there is not buying it and the thing they ranch for a second we learn this in college actually learns in high school is the physiology class right temperature blood pressure heart rate all these things are in physiology class in college a little bit more in medical school we learned about the human body at a very very deep level and the physiology is where it happens because the body functions with physiology becomes ill when it dysfunctions so we're focused on structure and so the problem is we're just called medically unexplained symptoms by chance m u s sounds familiar well started out in two thousand and two in the failure practice literature you say well we know you've all these symptoms we kind of we can't find a source we call it medically unexplained symptoms was it terrible diagnosis because people give up hope ok they know it's going on there does the idea of the diagnosis was to acknowledge the fact that you hurt which is a start and we nothing we can do but can help you cope with it so that's wrong if we look at the physiology of stress and again stress is the problem coming in going to fight or flight because of stresses and threats you look at this is physiology of sustained stress everything is explained every single symptom i had is gone how can that be every cell in the body's bath in this chemical environment you know different organ systems have different functions so i migraine headaches they're gone but what happens is that the blood vessels of the brain get inflamed transmitters neurotransmitters are off and when you really regulate your physiology back to safety that goes away my ears were ringing tinnitus for many many years twenty five years i thought from construction work days and i do have some hearing loss it's gone is a renda symptom sounds sort of mild but the chronic really bothers you it's gone and the reason for that again i can theorize on it but it's gone lots of people in my course have had the tennis disappear but again fight or flight your nervous self has inflammatory cells your brain your brain itself is inflate so it takes less stress to set off this the sensations than the nerve connection in your body doubles so you have a hyperactive ear and receptive system in your ears ring my feet would burn like crazy especially at night that's gone skin rashes would pop up over my body that's gone and back pain neck pain that's gone so you say well how can that be physiology covers every cell in the body and if you come physiology all the symptoms disappear one person twenty four symptoms gone another gentleman had twenty surgeries and twenty nine surgeries in twenty years and his suffered it was just a huge mess of his life and he started work with my stuff about ten years ago and in about a year who pain free and ten years later he's living the best life of his entire life that's after twenty eight surgery there's two parts to healing one of them is to learn to your survival physiology is keeping you alive it's a gift so anxiety anger are gifts i mean how you survive without anger and anxiety we would not so you learn to separate your identity from these stress reactions is we take your identity in we take your stress reaction which are intended to be very unpleasant you take them personally you don't feel good and a lot of mental energy trying to compensate for this bad feelings was supposed to be bad so as you separate denny from the stress reactions and say look just take a thermometer visually on the other on the opposite wall and we feel really anxious angry and frustrated just visualize how high this morris going in you should use the tools to drop it down and so that's one part of it the other half is nurturing joy so again you can nurture joy if you're fighting stress not possible you can think you are in trying to distract yourself but it's such a mismatch it never works but if you try to run your pain stress physiology yes you reinforce it so we call it self induced deep healing as if you train your brain is a trained learned skills non positive thinking by the way which is another disaster but you sort of train your brain to be less reactive to the pain issue training to be less reactive is when you fight it you really reinforce the circuits we talk about it he reinforces circuits so you learn a common physiology and then when you're on then you do what you want to do so the healing actually occurs as you start living your life on your terms not by fighting the pain so i have little saying is quit fighting darkness and just turn on the light so it's a bit more complicated that but not much and i'll just be one example to one model here so we can maybe go on the the mental part of the conversation as far as these repetitive thought patterns but you know we came up with a model called dynamic healing so every living creature has sensory sceptors that takes input from the environment whatever environment that is you have the century input touch sound sight feel all these different sensations so those come into your nervous system and so you have your input your nervous system which processes all this and you have your output which is the physiology either threat or safety so there's ways of process your stresses differently so they have less impact on your nervous system there's ways of making nervous system going from hyper reactive to call and there is a physiology there's things you can dress lee learn the physiology on the input side of the good the goal is just more safety physiology so all these interventions come towards one goal so it's never one intervention solves a problem is a combination of just a life using different tools in your times of the day to calm down your physiology so for instance which you want to sample is if you're my office and you have chronic pain as you look when you walk in the office you'll never discuss your pain ever with anybody and because what's as input was input doing your physiology right so it is a bit deeper than there is just your physiology i'm sure never discuss your pain or discussion medical care no complaining no criticism giving unasked for advice and no gossip because what's it doing to your physiology right so that's one of the basic cardinal rules are simply no negativity and often we sure in some workshops back east those were a carnival rolls and it takes about six weeks actually slow that down because we all like to complain this is where we are and it's for hard especially the gossip part of people used to gossiping but it again fires a breath of physiology especially when you're in pain you are complaining about the doctors medical system there's illnesses you complain about when you're in pain and the are legitimate complaint but you want you do you want your brain on the problem or do you want to solution so this one example how we work on input for output for instance you probably have done this a lot with your clients where you do breath work like slow breathing stimulus was called the biggest nerve which is anti inflammatory or rubbing your forehead stimulates the fifth cranial nerve i'm sure the same fifth grain or in the forehead i actually took that little tool for my cat so i can call my cat down really quickly by rubbing her forehead so also sound there's some pitches of music that really stimulate the biggest nerve and actually causing to calm down issue lower the physiology is for is the nervous system itself you make it more resilient was sleep is number one you have to sleep diet you know to find her diet and exercise are the three big ones as far as the nervous system so your sister be call or hyperactive and sometimes you come from an abusive environment or system to be feel safe so i taking a feral cat and try to calm it down you can't talk to it you said to teach it how to feel safe so that's where the dynamic healing you have your input or stresses your nervous system or copy skills you have your physiology the output and we have threat physiology then you have symptoms so the root cause the root cause of illness is interaction between your stresses in your coping skills so we're treating only the symptoms so the root causes and we close being address so it's like trying to put on an oil well fire with a garden hose you know the fuel keeps coming up and you've got to go to the root cause by dealing with so when we teach people to learn these tools about ten or fifteen minutes a day that's it we try to really really learn about pain or really solve the problem you're actually reinforcing the pain here's learning tools that use every day all day long you should not be work because one of the end to those anxiety is play is you think sort of playful curious attitude towards it that really comes of the physiology that's whole different topic they were the bottom line is that in a killing motor you change the input you increase your nervous system learn to lower the threat physiology then the symptoms resolve themselves i covered a lot of ground there\n\nSPEAKER_00: i was just thinking i think you've covered everything that i've been working to cover on this channel since it started we might just shut down the channel after today this is i think a mic drop moment\n\nSPEAKER_00: you've explained it so incredibly well and light bulbs are just going off all over the place as even thinking with my own journey for my first couple of years i was really laid out and really symptomatic and then i decided for a year that i was going to stop trying to fix myself because i didn't know what else to do and i wasn't going to talk about it i made a rule because i was tired of it being my whole identity and it was interesting it wasn't the whole fix but in that year just by stop trying to fix it and never talking about it again i started to feel better\n\nSPEAKER_00: one of a zillion little you know light bulb moments that were going off for me as you're talking about i think though i mean preaching to the choir here as well as to you know a lot of the people that watch this channel are pretty right up and up to speed on the science behind this but still understandably many have not been given this information or are just hearing it for the first time and it sounds a little bit off because i still hear every day from people i have all these symptoms i'm really struggling to believe that i'm going to be able to get rid of them all without surgery or medication so what was you estimate what percentage of chronic debilitating symptoms are alleviated with surgery or medication\n\nSPEAKER_01: memory treating symptoms so surgery symptom and so my one pain of the body so to me a long time to figure this out so let's take back pain there is not operation should ever be done with back pain ever works the reason for that is first of all the same acute lumbar strain you strain your back and about half of people by the way this developing backstrain it goes on to be chronic so the m r i scans what happens there's a pain center in the brain lights up back pain in about six or twelve months actually shifts to the emotional center the same pain but a different driver is a definition of chronic pain is a embedded memory that becomes connected to more and more life experiences and the memory cannot be erased and it cannot these pain circuits are absolutely permanent is similar to phantom limb pain or leg is cut off here why is the pain still there the structures gone in so the brain if you think about this carefully every living creature to memorize everything all the time otherwise we don't stay alive you know when across the street we know we're not looking to the sun we know how to stay safe but your brain's taking it in if mission every second so which is really information it just ignores it because it's safe so the new comes up you have to analyze it but your brain memorizes everything but especially pain and so it sounds discouraging but he is the more you try to fight it and solve it the more you reinforce it so you really are going to get rid of these pain circuits you can walk through them you walk past them you can transcend but you can't fight them and so what you're doing is you learn to separate yourself from your pain in the first thing that happens by the way with mental pain and physical pain is that you change your relationship to the pain is the pain she or you're here\n\nSPEAKER_01: as you start getting on with your life the way you want to your terms that's the solution it's really is so from neuroplasticity standpoint by the way neuroplasticity i'm sure knows it we do not i didn't know this medical school i'm sure we even knew it back in medical school but your brain changes by the second we thought that the brain was static in sort of lost cells as you get older and it changes every millisecond so even right now both of our brains have changed and so what you're doing you're trying to direct the brain to change the direction she want and that's why if you start living life that you want and you quit fighting the old one that part of your old brain starts atrophy so the circuit is still there they can be triggered any time but they really attribute the point where they just don't bother anymore so it's consistent one example right now again i don't know if the eyes comprehensive depression o c d bipolar his metabolic inflammatory disorders they're not psychological so in zari is the term we use when you're fight or flight so it just describes humans have this description for fight or flight who calls it just a descriptive term is not a psychological diagnosis she learned to live with it be with it i don't like to embrace it but you do embrace it because it's part of keep you alive he just go on your way\n\nSPEAKER_00: we talk a lot here on the channel about the conscious brain and unconscious brain so what is the relationship between those two and why is it important to understand that when it comes to chronic conditions\n\nSPEAKER_01: well chronic disease is a state and dr navio at mitochondrial has shown that you have chronic illness is motor connect they don't heal she actually shift that state before you actually can move forward if you use an acute interventions for economic problem it doesn't work so what you're doing is learn how to calm down physiology and then move forward you know so the question was exactly what again\n\nSPEAKER_00: understand it we talk about some things happened in our unconscious brain and other things we happen in our conscious brain and we need to bring things from the unconscious to the conscious there i just i think it gets a bit confusing for people understanding the relationship between the two and you know how this relates to their symptoms and their recovery\n\nSPEAKER_01: so the unconscious brain keeps you alive we do not need conscious brain to stay alive so we use conscious brain you have to be careful because you know animals have consciousness also right our animals look at things analyzing decisions but they don't have thoughts they don't have language to put meaning to it so they still respond if we do not have a new cortex we still stay alive chimpanzees have ninety nine point nine percent of the d n a we do you have quite a bit of intellectual capacity but they don't have this huge neocortex so remember the unconscious brain is eleven million bits of your patient per second the conscious brain is forty that's it so you can't control it and so it's like trying to drag stir with handbrakes dr work with a conscious brain does it gives you the steering wheel you can steer and direct it wherever you want so your conscious brain will react to whatever you put into it again if you consciously decide to complain to be negative that's what's going to happen your conscious brain is respond to what you put into it so it's a forty bits of information per second eleven million you decide what you want to load into this thing if you're put loaded negative you have a massive survival reaction and so the other thing is that this is been also eight hundred which i'm really disturbed about his house on a couple weeks ago but if you see somebody dangerous walking across the street your body actually responds first before you have thoughts it's the actually physiology first so it's about a one to ten second delay your body automatically reacted by the time you think about it so let's have a thoughts for second new book on repetitive i wanted thoughts and so what i learned in my own experience is i have full blown obsessive compulsive disorder which is marked by really extreme intrusive thoughts and most people don't have that but just by definition the way the brain works and this is where i think humanity's going to come up this different solution for this is that your threat physiology creates unpleasant thought because what happens you're the conscious brain is interpreted the sensations made by your unconscious nervous system we call it intraception so if you're buying fight or flight your conscious brain gives different meanings to these sensations you know as an in the same or a negative words you know sad shame embarrass all these different things are meanings we give to a physiology so the way your brain is working is that your your physiology creates the unpleasant thoughts then the thoughts themselves become input that actually strikes up the physiology this very bi directional and so after a while with repetition the thoughts become embedded in different triggers always fire the physiology vice versa so if you're anxious frustrated for any reason you're from negative thoughts then the negative thoughts can also become their own input so this one part is by directional that's very unique to humans so we're through unwanted thoughts or rumination why ninety five percent people ninety five percent of people have these things about seventy percent of people have a lot of destruction lifestyle i had extreme form showing about two or three percent population of extreme intrusive thoughts really negative really negative with all the physical symptoms i had the two worst parts my deal were these repetitive thought patterns they were just horrible so by the way is also direct relationship between thoughts and suicide actually attempted suicide miss whole thing and what drove me to that was the thoughts they just would not stop so i noticed over the years of people's pain would disappear their anxiety would drop and these thought patterns spinning away so forcefully my experience they actually disappeared they're gone but i could figure out why and so you have to understand is that there's a four part process when these thoughts so the miracle i just start with is that of a hornet's nest where the nest river is your system or your brain in the horse or your thoughts you know somebody shakes the nest the hornets are pretty unhappy is what we're doing right side fighting these hornets which is making them more angry the real interest which shaking the nest so the four parts of solving this pattern says number one separate from the thoughts that's where my friend is conducted behavior therapy comes into play if you heard six size call expressive writing if you work with that much so that separates you from the thoughts not solving them to say thought separation process and then the nervous system so the first of a separate from your thoughts calm physiology the third part destroy i mean dissolve your ego and the fourth partner plasticity so thought separations of first part where you learn to express and look at him mindfulness is the same thing you simply the thoughts are here you're here in common physiology is a stylish healing model we change the input the nervous system the output and what you're doing is mostly around anger so people are angry about a lot of things they always have been particular this day and age with a lot of sensory input we're overwhelmed or frustrated we feel trapped and when you're angry your nervous system is really fired up so there's a bunch of tools i call it anger processing to calm things down is sort of beyond the scope of this discussion but calm physiology does actually critical so physiology drives the thoughts in medicine we're not addressing the physiology so do it in the summer of carnita processes to deal with these thoughts in not even the root cause at all the third part which made you know just go for this discussion that we develop an ego for a couple reasons one of them is our stress physiology is unpleasant it's just feel bad so we develop this story about ourselves to feel better about ourselves second of all we're mostly programmed by negativity right\n\nSPEAKER_01: we're raised by criticism do this do this should do this shouldn't do that so we're sort of programmed through our lifetime with negativity so we develop our own internal story about ourselves to feel better and then the third reason is we're competitive species like every other creature so we want to look good so we spend a lot of time building up this appearance to other people but also to ourselves to look good it takes a lot of mental energy to do that so on top of that we suppress negativity so the suppressed thoughts emotion really fire up this whole process or ruts and then it develops into mental what's called mental rigidity which is cemented in my anger is this really fixed view of yourself it's not solvable that's where conspiracy theories come into a big play with these thoughts about life in general that this and this so rigid thinking is a huge block to healing is a huge block to treatment you get a certain mindset and it's not so it's not changeable so that's the challenge we deal with now is if you're open to actually engaging people heal but the key issue is people don't believe it you mentioned earlier well what if you talk about this people don't buy into it well it's a problem so i ask people don't believe me so when you leave this podcast or tv show don't believe anything i said the key is connect to what's in there which is skepticism so i said you don't have to believe anything and david hanscom or the process or whatever it is believe that your body knows how to heal so connecting with what is is a huge factor so connect with your skepticism is actually the starting point you start doing the work now letting your brain start to change then the fourth part where the healing actually occurs we talked about this before you separate from your physiology over here because you nurture joy good food good wine good friends your brain develops that direction that's the definitive healing it's not by fixing the negative side it's by nurturing the good side so with these thought patterns you got your thought separation call the physiology the driving force the third thing which has to happen relatively quickly is kill your ego you don't need it you understand your three physiologies over here you're not taking it personally you don't need an ego it's a ways to think about it so think how much time we spend with me being king of this how much time we spend build up an appearance that we think is okay so that takes mental energy that my cat doesn't spend time with so you know she just gets what she wants anyway so she doesn't need an ego\n\nSPEAKER_00: so that goes so i'm thinking about the people listening watching and i think there's a tendency for people to think i'm somehow going to be the one person that this doesn't apply to so for people who learn what this is about who implement strategies who follow this course of moving forward i mean what percentage of people would you estimate that this could be beneficial for for people with these chronic symptoms\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i'll tell you that i don't know all i know that depends on this repetition so it depends how committed you are to learning the skills the focus is on the skills not believing so usually calm your physiology and let your body heal the hardest part of this project by far is people can't help but try to fix themselves and when you do that of course your attention's on the problem so we learn to be with the problem and then move a different direction so if people engage is a high percentage heal but it may take a week usually obviously being three to six months of repetition is a key issue here and it takes a while to learn how to play the piano learn how to become a professional at anything and people might say well i don't want to become a professional oh really i mean you basically become a professional at life skills so we're not being the highest level professional learn how to rig your physiology so i'll just give you one example i mean i have a lot of people in there the thought patterns are a little bit something i'm learning i mean it's really tough to break through these thought patterns as far as the pain and anxiety that can drop down relatively quickly i'm on a learning curve as far as the thought patterns but one gentleman who i saw a couple months ago he's a friend of a friend now i'm not in clinical practice so i can give guidance so he was having surgery recommended a normal spine who's like a long spine fusion international he was suicidally depressed so the data has shown forever again the whole process evolved of just just by trying to follow the research about what we're supposed to do so none of this is something i made up or invented or some magic formula is just following the science so the data even if i didn't know any of those clear back forty years ago you don't operate on people that are suicidally depressed you just don't do that well that's being done all the time now and so that operation in that circumstance would have put him in and this is what it would show my practice so it started the process that i'm working on about six weeks ago i talked to a couple days ago his mood is way better depression is lifted he's not suicidal the pain is still there but he doesn't react so much which is always the first thing with pain that is there doesn't bother you as much eventually as you keep going different direction informing new circuits in your brain those new circuits don't have pain so people do go to pain free and it's better repetition and learning tools but again we call it deep self induced healing if you allow your body be a state of physiology your body heals itself so this might be confusing but i'm going to try anyway there's a concept of self help versus deep healing so self help helps symptoms and if you contribute contributed to healing but the idea of self help is i want to learn enough tools i want to be really good about processing pain because i want less pain the pain of the show so inadvertently self help processes tend to reinforce chronic pain so deep healing is learning to not react to the pain be with the pain and then go a different direction so letting go the fixing process is really challenging that's probably the biggest step is letting go\n\nSPEAKER_00: this is incredible i'm just thinking this is a lot of information for people watching listening so if you're feeling like i think maybe i retained ten percent of that don't worry watch it again i'm already thinking i'm going to have to go back and replay this and i'm wondering what resources what information what do you have available for people who want to learn more about this from you and get some support on their journey\n\nSPEAKER_01: so all my resources are on my website back in control com one word and then on the front page there there's a lot of resources we put up some books which really just nice summaries of the situation just to really a simple start to it i have a book back in control a surgery on a chronic pain and then i have a course called the doc journey direct your own care journey it's a computer based course and i recommend people spend maybe about ten or twenty minutes a day on it that's it it shouldn't be work should be curiosity what's going on look at it as just learning skills it's very self directed then i coach twice a week and tuesdays and thursdays at noon on a zoom call and so the coaching myself is not effective if you add the coaching to the course is very effective and so then i have all sorts of videos and blogs and probably too much stuff on the website but the core between the flip books the course the coaching is sort of in the book back in control get you started on what you're going to do incredible yeah\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay well make sure to have that all linked in the video description so people could check it out because you have hit the nail on the head for that all the key things that the experts that i bring on this channel talk about and explained it just also concisely so for people watching listening to yourself a favor take a moment look at some of those links because you know he's got the experience the knowledge and clearly a wonderful person so some really great resources there to make use of on your journey and i'm also going to link if you're watching this and this is resonating i did another interview with dr howard schubner you might be aware of so i'll link that up on the screen as well if people want to check that out it's just really incredible and really validating to have so many knowledgeable physicians coming forward and speaking about this and just validating the experiences of people going through this because for many years so many of us felt lost and or told it was all in our head or we were just being lazy or maybe making it up so this is impact just not only the validation but also tools a path forward you can get better\n\nSPEAKER_01: howard schumer is a good friend of mine he's my mentor oh and we play golf together we stay each other's houses and stuff so he's wonderful he's very academic he keeps doing the research on it and he's really really wonderful\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah he i've only interviewed him the one time but i just thought the world of him and he is another one who is just really changing so many people's lives it's it's incredible the work that people like yourself and him are doing thank you so much for being here i really appreciate this every sentence of this has been gold truly valuable i really appreciate it dr\n\nSPEAKER_01: thank you i really enjoyed our time\n\nSPEAKER_00: thanks to everyone for watching and listening and hope to see you in this next also incredibly information packed interview with dr howard

you've listened to even a few you can probably guess what book that is it's become such a phenomenon that there's even a term for it doctors call it book recoveries you read a book almost always this one specific book and you recover if you're new here welcome i'm raylan and don't worry in this video we're going to tell you what book that is each week here on the channel we dive deep into new recovery journeys from chronic conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome and long haul covid so we as a community can get inspired and learn from each other this famous book i mentioned changed everything for my guest today dr doug goufrida from the university of rochester after years of seemingly random unconnected health issues and unbearable back pain that he was told required surgery the information in this book didn't just help him avoid surgery and fully heal it also steered his career towards a whole new kind of research he now trains doctors to implement the same recovery strategies that have been so effective for him and so many others doug it was so great to have you here today thanks for doing this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah thank you thank you for having me\n\nSPEAKER_00: so you have had quite the journey with chronic pain and all of this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah sure so like a lot of providers i got into this because of my own chronic pain i had back pain i had a herniated disc with you know shown on an mri couldn't sit down for a year it was extreme pain and was going to get surgery while i waited for surgery i found a book by a guy named john sono a lot of i think a lot of your readers or viewers are familiar with and read the book found a therapist to do some of the harder work and my back pain was gone within a few months went back to all my activities play basketball sports and not only that but a lot of the other health problems i had suffered with for years went away i had arthritic knee i had what nowadays would be called ibs i think that was probably before that diagnosis existed this was over twenty years ago shoulder pain\n\nSPEAKER_01: headaches i mean you name it i had all kinds of stuff that you know one would go away and the other would come back i actually had heartburn so bad i had surgery for acid reflux which i wish i never had now because i clearly didn't need it causes problems for me now but yeah so everything went away i didn't do much with it as a practitioner i'm a counselor but i didn't do chronic pain counseling in fact we didn't talk about it much with anyone because back then you know you talk about it with people they think you were nuts to say that something physical could be cured something psychological and so i whisper to people in the shadows about you should try this book but didn't do much with it and then a few years ago i took an administrative role at my university and it was one that was a very stressful i wasn't enjoying it and my back pain came back and so i had a conversation with my supervisor at that point to say look i can't do this back hurting it's clearly bothering me for a while she had a hard time letting me out of the role and finally she said okay fine don't want to do this what do you want to do then and i said well i want to do chronic pain counseling and it wasn't my area i had been studying how to keep kids in college that was my college retention and she said well great we have a medical center here if you want to learn something new you can find someone i'll actually support you to do a fellowship and so she supported me i found the fellowship at the university who does this work with people with seizures bill watson who's a psychologist who works in the department of neurology he opened me up to the whole world of what we'll talk about later which is istp focused therapy bill uses this with seizure patients about forty percent of seizures are not epileptic meaning there's no chemical activity in the brain indicating any seizures and they're what's called psychogenic seizures and they use the same emotion focused approach i'll talk about to cure people of psychogenic seizures so i studied with bill i got to learn from a guy named howard schumer who some of your listeners are probably familiar with alan abbas is another big person in this field did a lot of my own work learning it engaging in it did what's called core training and istdp which is a pretty intensive\n\nSPEAKER_01: three year training approach with a local expert named marvin scorman and then opened my whole private practice\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow and just try even i'm still stuck on the point where they were telling you that you needed surgery because your chronic pain back pain and leg pain had been quite severe\n\nSPEAKER_01: i couldn't sit down i couldn't move i would be locked up on the floor for you know sometimes hours at a time i got out of my car once at work and dropped to the ground couldn't get up for i don't know a couple hours in the parking lot i mean it was severe and you know there was visual evidence to indicate there was a structural problem now what we know now is that's all pretty much nonsense my back looked the same before it hurt it probably looks the same now you know there's quite a bit of research supporting the fact that back shoulders knees change as we age they look different just like hair turns gray our backs get narrow separate show little cracks they don't that doesn't cause pain just like gray hair doesn't hurt it's a psychological problem there's quite a bit of evidence now indicating there's really no very little relationship between observed structural changes back almost everybody you probably show herniated disc most people over the age of thirty show one of these things that would be diagnosable but don't have\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it's interesting our understanding of chronic pain now because we used to think not so long ago well if there's no structural damage maybe this is a psychogenic thing but now we're seeing that there's very little correlation between the level of structural damage and the pain that you're experiencing or that the pain being an indication of a level of structural damage they just really aren't\n\nSPEAKER_01: radiologists can't tell from looking at images who has pain which should be pretty clear cut but it's not\n\nSPEAKER_00: so when you read dr john sarno's book what was it from the book that was resonating for you and making you think okay this might be what's happening for me\n\nSPEAKER_01: well the symptoms right the fact that i had always had something really since i was a kid stomach problems headaches digestive problems you know sleep problems it was always something one would go away and the other one so you just find this carousel specialists that are just looking at one particular body part that really resonated the personality characteristics i don't know if you're familiar with some of the things sorrow talked about but they're they're so true for me most of my clients that i see really highly motivated ambitious hardworking but also really uncomfortable with strong emotions we're the people that run around trying to make everyone feel better we don't like it when people get upset you know we can have a party and everybody has a great time but if one person is unhappy we're really upset about that those kinds of things\n\nSPEAKER_00: i know a lot of people watching will be familiar with the book and have heard about it but many won't have read it so the approach to treating this what does that look like from that perspective\n\nSPEAKER_01: well sorrow said that a lot of people could get better just by reading the book and i know you mentioned in one of your interviews with the fact folks talk to you about that too just the idea that it resonates with it this isn't a structural problem there's nothing wrong with physically i just have to get in touch with my emotions you know learn to not be afraid of things and engage in things in more gradual persistent way he said about eighty percent of his patients got better just doing that i wasn't one of them and a number of us the people that i see usually are you know they have read it they're familiar with it that's why they find me but they're still struggling and so what we engage with now is a process called tensive short term dynamic psychotherapy i do some of the other things that i think your viewers are probably familiar with brain reprocessing pain neuroscience education i think those are some of the buzzwords that i definitely use those tools but for me the core of the intervention is this emotion focused approach the idea is all emotions are healthy we're born emotional human beings with this whole range of really intense feelings that need to be there for us to transition\n\nSPEAKER_01: even things that we consider negative emotions grief loss intense anger and rage you know those things are all helpful to us to mobilize us to advocate ourselves but we learn early on often from our caregivers that some emotions are okay healthy and some emotions are really problematic and even dangerous and so we develop strategies sometimes even before we even can talk to adapt to our environment to protect ourselves and others from these emotions that we learn are not okay so we are born the most helpless creatures on the planet right if you watch a horse born you know they jump up and run away right babies are completely helpless our human babies are our entire existence depends upon between us and our caregiver and so we learn to adapt ourselves to fit in that environment to get the care sometimes this can happen where parents are ragers angry painful see all this fighting can come because of abuse but more often than not it can come because really good parents just are really uncomfortable with the fits that a kid throws or the range of emotions that a kid might show probably a lot of people have seen the disease movie inside out it's just a beautiful depiction of really good parents and teach a kid that where's my happy girl and you can't be upset put a smile on that kind of thing and so we learn to disconnect from these emotions to sit with the needs of our environment and we develop strategies to ward off these uncomfortable or dangerous emotions one of the strategies can be varied but for chronic pain patients it tends to be physical pain parents who might not be adapted handling their anger their rage fits become very mobilized when they have a stomach ache or a headache or hurt themselves and they learn this and so subconsciously we're able to transform this physical or these emotions into physical form there's actually quite a bit of mri research that supports this process which is really quite amazing that we're sort of supporting the things from you know the eighteen hundreds now mri research with people chronic pain versus acute pain looks very very different acute pain which they'll put someone in an mri kind of apply heat to their finger in a way that doesn't hurt the finger but hurts a lot you see the brain lights up there's not one pain center like there is an emotional visual cortex or auditory cortex it sort of lights up all over across the brain but you put people with back pain for example\n\nSPEAKER_01: their brains light up one little teeny place called\n\nSPEAKER_01: you might guess what the amygdala does if you're not familiar it's part of us responsible for emotions anger rage\n\nSPEAKER_01: it looks very different so science is actually backing up the idea emotions can be transformed physical form\n\nSPEAKER_00: and we know all this now and we can have these conversations but with your experience because he said you know back then you couldn't even need kind of whisper this in the shadows what's your experience now with people knowing and understanding and accepting this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah most of the folks that i work with come to me because they know and understand and accept this but it's it's and some folks can work through the process very quickly and istdp we call those low resistance patients they come in ready to go all these defenses have been lowered they understand what they need to do they trust me they trust the process and you can just see this transformation pretty quickly these are some of the more remarkable recovery stories you might see or very quickly we're able to like work through the little bit of defenses point them out they notice them we work together to kind of you know work through them and then these emotions can kind of come up other people it's more complicated and it's harder i was one of the people that's more complicated i still am to this day very guarded and defended i still am in therapy and i have a lot of challenges getting in a lot of the core issues and emotions but i'll tell you a little bit more about what the process looks like i guess what gets in the way so we might start talking about something it's not a big deal\n\nSPEAKER_01: in istdp we're always checking what do you notice in your body as you talk about this person\n\nSPEAKER_01: often our anger comes in and when we check into the body body doesn't lie brain will lie they'll say i'm angry i'm so mad\n\nSPEAKER_01: but we check in the body and often in the beginning you'll see tension\n\nSPEAKER_01: right what do you notice my stomach's tight i feel constriction\n\nSPEAKER_01: my shoulders you know those are the different places and that's anxiety they don't know they're anxious subconscious what they're anxious about are these feelings that ward off tense rage anger and actually underneath all of that guilt and so once they get to notice that they realize they're not really angry at all they know they should be but their bodies are really afraid about this feeling and so and usually the pain will start like in groups it's it's really quite funny to watch when i run through someone get activated you'll see the other people oh my god this chair you know to stand up adjust or you know they just get activated by other people's emotion and so we teach them that you know they might have to get up and go to the bathroom people with ip style coffee i gotta go to the bathroom that's a way to ward off the feelings another way is what we call cognitive disruption they lose their train of thought happens all the time or just talking about what did you ask i can't remember what you said that's that's a defense and so we'll point these out intellectualization well i need to just forgive them she had a hard life we get there istp gets tremendous forgiveness but you can't short circuit it with defensive behavior so once they are able to work through those real the somatic experience of anger and rage is often allowed to come through that's very different it's a looseness it's it's a warmth it wants to move and push up and out of the person we'll see them sign\n\nSPEAKER_01: that's an activation we'll notice hands moving clenching sometimes grabbing we watch the leg movement when you see activation and they talk about a warm loose feeling that's a somatic experience of grabbing\n\nSPEAKER_01: and sometimes we'll ask them they'll have visions you know quick images i have this picture person sometimes it's not even a person start to talk about it quickly go to primary caregivers people who use them it's called unlocking it comes out in its fullest form it is the most dramatic part of the healing process it doesn't happen in all cases but when it does it usually leads to some pretty dramatic improvements\n\nSPEAKER_00: what sorts of conditions or symptoms are people coming in to address with this\n\nSPEAKER_01: back pain knee pain shoulder pain headaches fibromyalgia so i didn't get into this you know i got in it more for the those kinds of issues my first two clients i saw both had fibromyalgia i didn't know much about it at the time this is going back about ten years but i had read some of schumer and lumbley's work that they had effectively so i started using it with them with an understanding to say hey you're the first people i've seen with this i can't really promise you know what will happen i just know that other people and they both got better very very quickly in fact went back to their doctors and told them they were cured the doctor called me to say what what happened\n\nSPEAKER_01: this happened and as you can imagine after that my practice really picked up quickly so i have been working more with folks with fibromyalgia i take them readily because i do believe that it's the only thing that i've learned that really can cure it at least you know keep in mind the people i see have been through everything else i'm never the first stop usually the last so you know they'll come with all these other things that they've done and tried a lot of frustration about it i started to work with people with long covid and me those were not on my initial list but\n\nSPEAKER_01: with long covid i was very hesitant because i didn't know what it was or what was going on last thing i wanted to say that this could be helpful there was no evidence out there and i had never seen anyone but there is starting to be some research showing that emotion focused therapy and helpful so i have started to see people with long covid and me and have been having some success with that as well\n\nSPEAKER_00: are you seeing a shift in the professional community in terms of accepting this sort of therapy and treatment\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah that's been the most amazing thing as someone who you know went through his own process over twenty years ago and kind of as i said hid in the shadows with this it's it's really been incredible to watch the change in fact right after this i'm going to switch to another zoom meeting and i'm training doctors here in our local hospital on this as part of a community of us that's been doing this work so yes i get calls from doctors a lot now not just for you know training or teach me about this but can you see my patients because you know there's a growing recognition even in medical school now they're starting to get some there was no pain curriculum medical school and they're starting to have one now and starting to look to scientifically supported approaches back pain is not scientifically supported or back surgery the evidence shows that most people with back pain only twenty to thirty percent of them get better and most of them have long term problems after one of the biggest diagnoses now is failed back surgery syndrome just doesn't work in most cases and our approaches have much higher success rates that research is really supportive\n\nSPEAKER_00: so what do you think about the people out there that are maybe a bit resistant to this idea or reluctant to go into therapy because it's going to be a really painful thing to endure but yet they're still struggling with their health what do you think what do you think's happening there\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah that's that's a good question dealing with emotions is never easy it is some of the hardest work that we'll ever do istdp is incredibly difficult approach it's incredibly supportive of people but it's different and i do liken it to you know some different therapies that people go to that they found helpful but don't cure them which i used to do cognitive behavioral therapy person centered therapy those were my approaches prior to\n\nSPEAKER_01: they were helpful but i liken them more to like a walk like walking is really good for it's great for your health right everybody should go for a walk and walk a lot and it's easy and it doesn't cause istdp is more like crossfit right if you really want to change your body going for a twenty minute walk every day is not going to do it you got to get in the gym and put the more severe work and that's what i like\n\nSPEAKER_01: a really supportive crossfit coach because the goal for us we have this threshold that we're working at right this emotional capacity that people have for these difficulties and most people with chronic pain or emotional thresholds very low and so what we want to do is increase the threshold gradually and our therapy should get people to the emotion that they can tolerate deal with without going over because it will have setbacks without staying too low because then we won't see progress just like good fitness right just take off and run a marathon after just walking ten minutes you would build up to it to your maximum capacity so that's the goal with istp so we do look to take people you know a little bit further every time without going too far that's difficult\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i suspect one of the biggest barriers for people is even before this because most of us think of our you know mental health and our physical health and those are two separate things and if you're going through major physical health problems addressing your mental health stuff is a nice to have when i was really sick i started going into therapy and counseling but it wasn't to make myself get better that wasn't my motivation it was just to help me cope with the sickness and keep me going until i found my physical cure so it's it's such a change in mindset and our understanding of what's happening to even get people to the place where they see this as a part of their path to getting better\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah my clients will say that all the time people\n\nSPEAKER_01: say this looks different why didn't i find this my answer is always the same you find this when the time's right and not everyone's ready for this at this point in their lives and you know probably about seventy to eighty percent of my people get better but twenty to thirty percent it's not the right time for them and we'll decide together that it's not and one of the things i published a study on a group that i ran we were actually looking at data and one of the things we do notice is that people get better generally have a setback at some point as things start to get more difficult emotionally these defenses get really activated and their symptoms will flare up or new things will happen and that's the time that's the make or break time people who really believe in it and know that a setback is part of the progress we'll stick with it and work through it and get better and people that aren't so sure about this will say well this is just bringing up all kinds of stuff you know i'm already sick you know now i got to deal with all these emotions too and they might be the ones that decide this isn't the right time for them people get better in my study were the ones that believed in it so much at the start that they worked through the setbacks and were able to make a lot of progress after that\n\nSPEAKER_00: well doug this is just incredible i just my head explodes every time i have a conversation with someone like yourself it's so amazing to have professionals out there who are aware of this and out there and available and helping people because\n\nSPEAKER_00: it's not the case just a very short time ago so i really appreciate you taking the time today to walk us through this and to show us you know the science behind it this is real this is helpful and it is that message that it is coming into mainstream conventional practices is really encouraging to hear as well so yeah thank you so much for this\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're welcome thank you for talking to me i appreciate it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i'm curious from the viewers what questions you have love to see it and what's your experience been with all of this what's your take and also want to send a shout out to channel member yousef david thank you so much you said for the support and joining the channel sending big hugs to you i really appreciate it and for people watching i know this is a lot to take in if you're not already on my mailing list i do send out a weekly newsletter that summarizes and bullet points kind of the key takeaways from the interviews if you're not able to capture them all so there's a link for that in the video description as well so yeah thank you again doug thank you to those of you watching sending you massive hugs i hope you

you've listened to even a few you can probably guess what book that is it's become such a phenomenon that there's even a term for it doctors call it book recoveries you read a book almost always this one specific book and you recover if you're new here welcome i'm raylan and don't worry in this video we're going to tell you what book that is each week here on the channel we dive deep into new recovery journeys from chronic conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome and long haul covid so we as a community can get inspired and learn from each other this famous book i mentioned changed everything for my guest today dr doug goufrida from the university of rochester after years of seemingly random unconnected health issues and unbearable back pain that he was told required surgery the information in this book didn't just help him avoid surgery and fully heal it also steered his career towards a whole new kind of research he now trains doctors to implement the same recovery strategies that have been so effective for him and so many others doug it was so great to have you here today thanks for doing this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah thank you thank you for having me\n\nSPEAKER_00: so you have had quite the journey with chronic pain and all of this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah sure so like a lot of providers i got into this because of my own chronic pain i had back pain i had a herniated disc with you know shown on an mri couldn't sit down for a year it was extreme pain and was going to get surgery while i waited for surgery i found a book by a guy named john sono a lot of i think a lot of your readers or viewers are familiar with and read the book found a therapist to do some of the harder work and my back pain was gone within a few months went back to all my activities play basketball sports and not only that but a lot of the other health problems i had suffered with for years went away i had arthritic knee i had what nowadays would be called ibs i think that was probably before that diagnosis existed this was over twenty years ago shoulder pain\n\nSPEAKER_01: headaches i mean you name it i had all kinds of stuff that you know one would go away and the other would come back i actually had heartburn so bad i had surgery for acid reflux which i wish i never had now because i clearly didn't need it causes problems for me now but yeah so everything went away i didn't do much with it as a practitioner i'm a counselor but i didn't do chronic pain counseling in fact we didn't talk about it much with anyone because back then you know you talk about it with people they think you were nuts to say that something physical could be cured something psychological and so i whisper to people in the shadows about you should try this book but didn't do much with it and then a few years ago i took an administrative role at my university and it was one that was a very stressful i wasn't enjoying it and my back pain came back and so i had a conversation with my supervisor at that point to say look i can't do this back hurting it's clearly bothering me for a while she had a hard time letting me out of the role and finally she said okay fine don't want to do this what do you want to do then and i said well i want to do chronic pain counseling and it wasn't my area i had been studying how to keep kids in college that was my college retention and she said well great we have a medical center here if you want to learn something new you can find someone i'll actually support you to do a fellowship and so she supported me i found the fellowship at the university who does this work with people with seizures bill watson who's a psychologist who works in the department of neurology he opened me up to the whole world of what we'll talk about later which is istp focused therapy bill uses this with seizure patients about forty percent of seizures are not epileptic meaning there's no chemical activity in the brain indicating any seizures and they're what's called psychogenic seizures and they use the same emotion focused approach i'll talk about to cure people of psychogenic seizures so i studied with bill i got to learn from a guy named howard schumer who some of your listeners are probably familiar with alan abbas is another big person in this field did a lot of my own work learning it engaging in it did what's called core training and istdp which is a pretty intensive\n\nSPEAKER_01: three year training approach with a local expert named marvin scorman and then opened my whole private practice\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow and just try even i'm still stuck on the point where they were telling you that you needed surgery because your chronic pain back pain and leg pain had been quite severe\n\nSPEAKER_01: i couldn't sit down i couldn't move i would be locked up on the floor for you know sometimes hours at a time i got out of my car once at work and dropped to the ground couldn't get up for i don't know a couple hours in the parking lot i mean it was severe and you know there was visual evidence to indicate there was a structural problem now what we know now is that's all pretty much nonsense my back looked the same before it hurt it probably looks the same now you know there's quite a bit of research supporting the fact that back shoulders knees change as we age they look different just like hair turns gray our backs get narrow separate show little cracks they don't that doesn't cause pain just like gray hair doesn't hurt it's a psychological problem there's quite a bit of evidence now indicating there's really no very little relationship between observed structural changes back almost everybody you probably show herniated disc most people over the age of thirty show one of these things that would be diagnosable but don't have\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it's interesting our understanding of chronic pain now because we used to think not so long ago well if there's no structural damage maybe this is a psychogenic thing but now we're seeing that there's very little correlation between the level of structural damage and the pain that you're experiencing or that the pain being an indication of a level of structural damage they just really aren't\n\nSPEAKER_01: radiologists can't tell from looking at images who has pain which should be pretty clear cut but it's not\n\nSPEAKER_00: so when you read dr john sarno's book what was it from the book that was resonating for you and making you think okay this might be what's happening for me\n\nSPEAKER_01: well the symptoms right the fact that i had always had something really since i was a kid stomach problems headaches digestive problems you know sleep problems it was always something one would go away and the other one so you just find this carousel specialists that are just looking at one particular body part that really resonated the personality characteristics i don't know if you're familiar with some of the things sorrow talked about but they're they're so true for me most of my clients that i see really highly motivated ambitious hardworking but also really uncomfortable with strong emotions we're the people that run around trying to make everyone feel better we don't like it when people get upset you know we can have a party and everybody has a great time but if one person is unhappy we're really upset about that those kinds of things\n\nSPEAKER_00: i know a lot of people watching will be familiar with the book and have heard about it but many won't have read it so the approach to treating this what does that look like from that perspective\n\nSPEAKER_01: well sorrow said that a lot of people could get better just by reading the book and i know you mentioned in one of your interviews with the fact folks talk to you about that too just the idea that it resonates with it this isn't a structural problem there's nothing wrong with physically i just have to get in touch with my emotions you know learn to not be afraid of things and engage in things in more gradual persistent way he said about eighty percent of his patients got better just doing that i wasn't one of them and a number of us the people that i see usually are you know they have read it they're familiar with it that's why they find me but they're still struggling and so what we engage with now is a process called tensive short term dynamic psychotherapy i do some of the other things that i think your viewers are probably familiar with brain reprocessing pain neuroscience education i think those are some of the buzzwords that i definitely use those tools but for me the core of the intervention is this emotion focused approach the idea is all emotions are healthy we're born emotional human beings with this whole range of really intense feelings that need to be there for us to transition\n\nSPEAKER_01: even things that we consider negative emotions grief loss intense anger and rage you know those things are all helpful to us to mobilize us to advocate ourselves but we learn early on often from our caregivers that some emotions are okay healthy and some emotions are really problematic and even dangerous and so we develop strategies sometimes even before we even can talk to adapt to our environment to protect ourselves and others from these emotions that we learn are not okay so we are born the most helpless creatures on the planet right if you watch a horse born you know they jump up and run away right babies are completely helpless our human babies are our entire existence depends upon between us and our caregiver and so we learn to adapt ourselves to fit in that environment to get the care sometimes this can happen where parents are ragers angry painful see all this fighting can come because of abuse but more often than not it can come because really good parents just are really uncomfortable with the fits that a kid throws or the range of emotions that a kid might show probably a lot of people have seen the disease movie inside out it's just a beautiful depiction of really good parents and teach a kid that where's my happy girl and you can't be upset put a smile on that kind of thing and so we learn to disconnect from these emotions to sit with the needs of our environment and we develop strategies to ward off these uncomfortable or dangerous emotions one of the strategies can be varied but for chronic pain patients it tends to be physical pain parents who might not be adapted handling their anger their rage fits become very mobilized when they have a stomach ache or a headache or hurt themselves and they learn this and so subconsciously we're able to transform this physical or these emotions into physical form there's actually quite a bit of mri research that supports this process which is really quite amazing that we're sort of supporting the things from you know the eighteen hundreds now mri research with people chronic pain versus acute pain looks very very different acute pain which they'll put someone in an mri kind of apply heat to their finger in a way that doesn't hurt the finger but hurts a lot you see the brain lights up there's not one pain center like there is an emotional visual cortex or auditory cortex it sort of lights up all over across the brain but you put people with back pain for example\n\nSPEAKER_01: their brains light up one little teeny place called\n\nSPEAKER_01: you might guess what the amygdala does if you're not familiar it's part of us responsible for emotions anger rage\n\nSPEAKER_01: it looks very different so science is actually backing up the idea emotions can be transformed physical form\n\nSPEAKER_00: and we know all this now and we can have these conversations but with your experience because he said you know back then you couldn't even need kind of whisper this in the shadows what's your experience now with people knowing and understanding and accepting this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah most of the folks that i work with come to me because they know and understand and accept this but it's it's and some folks can work through the process very quickly and istdp we call those low resistance patients they come in ready to go all these defenses have been lowered they understand what they need to do they trust me they trust the process and you can just see this transformation pretty quickly these are some of the more remarkable recovery stories you might see or very quickly we're able to like work through the little bit of defenses point them out they notice them we work together to kind of you know work through them and then these emotions can kind of come up other people it's more complicated and it's harder i was one of the people that's more complicated i still am to this day very guarded and defended i still am in therapy and i have a lot of challenges getting in a lot of the core issues and emotions but i'll tell you a little bit more about what the process looks like i guess what gets in the way so we might start talking about something it's not a big deal\n\nSPEAKER_01: in istdp we're always checking what do you notice in your body as you talk about this person\n\nSPEAKER_01: often our anger comes in and when we check into the body body doesn't lie brain will lie they'll say i'm angry i'm so mad\n\nSPEAKER_01: but we check in the body and often in the beginning you'll see tension\n\nSPEAKER_01: right what do you notice my stomach's tight i feel constriction\n\nSPEAKER_01: my shoulders you know those are the different places and that's anxiety they don't know they're anxious subconscious what they're anxious about are these feelings that ward off tense rage anger and actually underneath all of that guilt and so once they get to notice that they realize they're not really angry at all they know they should be but their bodies are really afraid about this feeling and so and usually the pain will start like in groups it's it's really quite funny to watch when i run through someone get activated you'll see the other people oh my god this chair you know to stand up adjust or you know they just get activated by other people's emotion and so we teach them that you know they might have to get up and go to the bathroom people with ip style coffee i gotta go to the bathroom that's a way to ward off the feelings another way is what we call cognitive disruption they lose their train of thought happens all the time or just talking about what did you ask i can't remember what you said that's that's a defense and so we'll point these out intellectualization well i need to just forgive them she had a hard life we get there istp gets tremendous forgiveness but you can't short circuit it with defensive behavior so once they are able to work through those real the somatic experience of anger and rage is often allowed to come through that's very different it's a looseness it's it's a warmth it wants to move and push up and out of the person we'll see them sign\n\nSPEAKER_01: that's an activation we'll notice hands moving clenching sometimes grabbing we watch the leg movement when you see activation and they talk about a warm loose feeling that's a somatic experience of grabbing\n\nSPEAKER_01: and sometimes we'll ask them they'll have visions you know quick images i have this picture person sometimes it's not even a person start to talk about it quickly go to primary caregivers people who use them it's called unlocking it comes out in its fullest form it is the most dramatic part of the healing process it doesn't happen in all cases but when it does it usually leads to some pretty dramatic improvements\n\nSPEAKER_00: what sorts of conditions or symptoms are people coming in to address with this\n\nSPEAKER_01: back pain knee pain shoulder pain headaches fibromyalgia so i didn't get into this you know i got in it more for the those kinds of issues my first two clients i saw both had fibromyalgia i didn't know much about it at the time this is going back about ten years but i had read some of schumer and lumbley's work that they had effectively so i started using it with them with an understanding to say hey you're the first people i've seen with this i can't really promise you know what will happen i just know that other people and they both got better very very quickly in fact went back to their doctors and told them they were cured the doctor called me to say what what happened\n\nSPEAKER_01: this happened and as you can imagine after that my practice really picked up quickly so i have been working more with folks with fibromyalgia i take them readily because i do believe that it's the only thing that i've learned that really can cure it at least you know keep in mind the people i see have been through everything else i'm never the first stop usually the last so you know they'll come with all these other things that they've done and tried a lot of frustration about it i started to work with people with long covid and me those were not on my initial list but\n\nSPEAKER_01: with long covid i was very hesitant because i didn't know what it was or what was going on last thing i wanted to say that this could be helpful there was no evidence out there and i had never seen anyone but there is starting to be some research showing that emotion focused therapy and helpful so i have started to see people with long covid and me and have been having some success with that as well\n\nSPEAKER_00: are you seeing a shift in the professional community in terms of accepting this sort of therapy and treatment\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah that's been the most amazing thing as someone who you know went through his own process over twenty years ago and kind of as i said hid in the shadows with this it's it's really been incredible to watch the change in fact right after this i'm going to switch to another zoom meeting and i'm training doctors here in our local hospital on this as part of a community of us that's been doing this work so yes i get calls from doctors a lot now not just for you know training or teach me about this but can you see my patients because you know there's a growing recognition even in medical school now they're starting to get some there was no pain curriculum medical school and they're starting to have one now and starting to look to scientifically supported approaches back pain is not scientifically supported or back surgery the evidence shows that most people with back pain only twenty to thirty percent of them get better and most of them have long term problems after one of the biggest diagnoses now is failed back surgery syndrome just doesn't work in most cases and our approaches have much higher success rates that research is really supportive\n\nSPEAKER_00: so what do you think about the people out there that are maybe a bit resistant to this idea or reluctant to go into therapy because it's going to be a really painful thing to endure but yet they're still struggling with their health what do you think what do you think's happening there\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah that's that's a good question dealing with emotions is never easy it is some of the hardest work that we'll ever do istdp is incredibly difficult approach it's incredibly supportive of people but it's different and i do liken it to you know some different therapies that people go to that they found helpful but don't cure them which i used to do cognitive behavioral therapy person centered therapy those were my approaches prior to\n\nSPEAKER_01: they were helpful but i liken them more to like a walk like walking is really good for it's great for your health right everybody should go for a walk and walk a lot and it's easy and it doesn't cause istdp is more like crossfit right if you really want to change your body going for a twenty minute walk every day is not going to do it you got to get in the gym and put the more severe work and that's what i like\n\nSPEAKER_01: a really supportive crossfit coach because the goal for us we have this threshold that we're working at right this emotional capacity that people have for these difficulties and most people with chronic pain or emotional thresholds very low and so what we want to do is increase the threshold gradually and our therapy should get people to the emotion that they can tolerate deal with without going over because it will have setbacks without staying too low because then we won't see progress just like good fitness right just take off and run a marathon after just walking ten minutes you would build up to it to your maximum capacity so that's the goal with istp so we do look to take people you know a little bit further every time without going too far that's difficult\n\nSPEAKER_00: and i suspect one of the biggest barriers for people is even before this because most of us think of our you know mental health and our physical health and those are two separate things and if you're going through major physical health problems addressing your mental health stuff is a nice to have when i was really sick i started going into therapy and counseling but it wasn't to make myself get better that wasn't my motivation it was just to help me cope with the sickness and keep me going until i found my physical cure so it's it's such a change in mindset and our understanding of what's happening to even get people to the place where they see this as a part of their path to getting better\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah my clients will say that all the time people\n\nSPEAKER_01: say this looks different why didn't i find this my answer is always the same you find this when the time's right and not everyone's ready for this at this point in their lives and you know probably about seventy to eighty percent of my people get better but twenty to thirty percent it's not the right time for them and we'll decide together that it's not and one of the things i published a study on a group that i ran we were actually looking at data and one of the things we do notice is that people get better generally have a setback at some point as things start to get more difficult emotionally these defenses get really activated and their symptoms will flare up or new things will happen and that's the time that's the make or break time people who really believe in it and know that a setback is part of the progress we'll stick with it and work through it and get better and people that aren't so sure about this will say well this is just bringing up all kinds of stuff you know i'm already sick you know now i got to deal with all these emotions too and they might be the ones that decide this isn't the right time for them people get better in my study were the ones that believed in it so much at the start that they worked through the setbacks and were able to make a lot of progress after that\n\nSPEAKER_00: well doug this is just incredible i just my head explodes every time i have a conversation with someone like yourself it's so amazing to have professionals out there who are aware of this and out there and available and helping people because\n\nSPEAKER_00: it's not the case just a very short time ago so i really appreciate you taking the time today to walk us through this and to show us you know the science behind it this is real this is helpful and it is that message that it is coming into mainstream conventional practices is really encouraging to hear as well so yeah thank you so much for this\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're welcome thank you for talking to me i appreciate it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i'm curious from the viewers what questions you have love to see it and what's your experience been with all of this what's your take and also want to send a shout out to channel member yousef david thank you so much you said for the support and joining the channel sending big hugs to you i really appreciate it and for people watching i know this is a lot to take in if you're not already on my mailing list i do send out a weekly newsletter that summarizes and bullet points kind of the key takeaways from the interviews if you're not able to capture them all so there's a link for that in the video description as well so yeah thank you again doug thank you to those of you watching sending you massive hugs i hope you

because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":51.24752331765422,"bm25_ratio":1.2454845203764988,"global_start":1890,"global_end":2190,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.5768721305377811,"llm_explanation":null,"llm_is_contained":null},{"quote":"I

week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in

i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked

kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":29.090489287728907,"bm25_ratio":1.2698756935477975,"global_start":2100,"global_end":2820,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.5581774692912297,"llm_explanation":"Text 1 is

definitely is possible it usually takes a while rapid recoveries are the exception but they are incredibly exciting when they do happen and today's interview is an example of just that hi everyone i'm ralan if you're new here welcome on this channel we explore recovery strategies and share real life stories every week to learn as much as we can from each other in fact these interviews are now part of a research study to discover what helps most people regain their health i'm super excited to have kelly with us today over in new york just four months after starting a recovery program she completed a ten k run and is now training for a full marathon so let's dive in and hear about her incredible journey and how she went from barely making it through the day to now running incredibly long distances kelly so great to have you here today thank you so much for being here and sharing your story yes thank you for having me so take us back you know to the beginning or before the beginning how did you how did this all start for you how did you start to notice that you something was off and you were well\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah so i typically am a very active person and i usually have a lot of energy to do different activities but there is a phase in my life where i just started to get really tired and i didn't have the motivation to go out and do as many activities and so i just started to notice things like laying in bed i would get these canker sores and just overall not feeling the best\n\nSPEAKER_00: and did you go to see a doctor what did you think was happening\n\nSPEAKER_01: i did go get my blood work done i thought maybe it was low iron or my electrolytes but my blood work came out pretty good and i thought maybe it was something mentally that was causing this\n\nSPEAKER_00: and what made you think that\n\nSPEAKER_01: just because i went to multiple doctors and they all said the same thing that everything was perfectly fine for my vitals my blood work but still i was getting lightheaded when i was standing up i didn't have as much focus during the day and the worst symptom was the mouth sores which i thought maybe had to do with me not handling my stress well\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay so it sounds like the doctors essentially sent you away with nothing and you were left to figure this out on your own so what did you do from there\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i heard about this program i can thrive and i was referred to the program by a family member and so i went to therapist before this to try to figure out some skills but none of them were as helpful as this program that i started to use\n\nSPEAKER_00: okay i've had jason on the channel before that's jason mctiernan's program correct i can thrive yeah i've interviewed a lot of people actually on the channel who have gone through his program and have recovered and interviewed him himself he's a great guy so what was it like going through the program for you and how did you find how do you think that it helped you to get past this and get where you are now\n\nSPEAKER_01: in the beginning i was a little skeptical because the program does have like a hypnosis type of effect in it where you're going through and imagining yourself at ease in a situation and trying to bring that into the future so i never really had that type of technique but once i really committed to learning the program it really made a difference and i could use all these little techniques in situations when i'm by myself such as like when i was driving in the car i get anxious and you really train your brain to think differently\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it is the whole program is based around i know a big component of it is this brain retraining piece which so many people are finding incredibly helpful with their journey had you heard of anything like this before you started doing this\n\nSPEAKER_01: i heard of going to a hypnotist which i never went to but i know some people like that i also heard of the emdr techniques for therapy so i movement desensitization and reprocessing but i never really tried his method\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just i asked because it can be a different way of thinking about healing than we usually do when our doctors tell us from what we grew up hearing about how you get well typically some sort of medication or surgery or something so to work with your brain to heal your body is a completely paradigm shift that we're in right now understanding healing and symptoms so once you started doing the program how quickly did you start to see progress\n\nSPEAKER_01: i started to see it maybe two weeks after it was pretty quick and compared to some other cases i know jason said that mine was a quicker recovery but yeah it really changed within six months i was back to feeling fully well\n\nSPEAKER_00: wow and since then you're even running ten k races can you tell us about that and what did that feel like\n\nSPEAKER_01: that was great my first ten k that i ran that year it was just motivating me to get back out there and challenge my body with physical activities right now i'm training for a full marathon with some of my friends and before i don't think i would have had the mental stamina to do that and now i just have that positive affirmations and changing the way of my mindset from fix to growth and it really has made a difference\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah going through these things does seem to transform people it's a horrible thing to go through but thankfully there's a lot of good that comes out of it do you have you noticed other changes within yourself for how you live your life now versus before you went through this\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah i definitely think that i am more eager to surround myself with people who have the growth mindset that they want to continue to challenge themselves and get better i also use a lot more of empowering statements where i didn't realize that saying like i am anxious is disempowering but instead you could say i am on my way to getting better and that's more of a journey rather than oh i'm stuck at this state of anxiety so definitely having those skills to keep positivity in my mind has helped my progress\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah it sounds like you took a lot away from the i can thrive program although it's meant for cfs and long covid and similar conditions recovery but like a lot of programs or like a lot of things that we do you learn a lot of tools that end up serving you in life past this and beyond this yeah so when you're going through the program if someone's watching it and they are thinking oh this might be a good fit for me what does it look like to actually do the program can you tell us what an average day or week looks like\n\nSPEAKER_01: sure so in the beginning you'll start to meet with jason more frequently and he will guide you through the meditating process you also have access to the resources so there's online videos that he'll send you i think one of the best parts of this program is how personable jason is so i would get text messages randomly and throughout my recovery saying i just climbed a mountain i know you can do it you're doing great and it's just great having someone who believes in you that much even though we were complete strangers and the program focuses on like you said heavy resources so we would do our coaching sessions i would watch the videos he would recommend audio books and he'd give you free copies over email and just pointing you to different authors that have similar experiences so you see that the evidence is out there that this program's working\n\nSPEAKER_00: amazing and are you do you feel fully past this now is this officially behind you\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think there's still some days where i do feel very tired but i have now these tools to fix that so obviously you know life is stressful i'm still going to have some anxious moments but i can refocus and use these tools to pass it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think that's a really good answer because i mean the question itself really you know what does it mean to be fully recovered and fully past this if anyone ever really you know because these are things that were happening in our brain and our nervous system and you know trying to send us signals and alarms and we want those things to keep working so we're going to keep going to keep having symptoms and different things in our lives to let us know what's going on i guess the great thing is is that we walk away feeling not scared of that because if something does pop up like okay i've got the tools i know what to do i can get past it yeah so for you have anything that you'd want to say to people who are watching right now who are still on their journey maybe feeling a little bit lost or hopeless or anything that you'd say to yourself if you could go back during those times\n\nSPEAKER_01: i would definitely validate what you're feeling even if you haven't found any doctors or any social support that has the same experience there are people out there who have these product fatigue syndromes whatever they're facing and this program truly could help all you need really is to be pointed to the right resources and you know just like jason he'll always tell you that you got this and it's a journey so can't just keep comparing yourself to where you've been like you're on the right path to recovery\n\nSPEAKER_00: amazing well i'm so so happy for you kelly this is incredible i'm happy you connected with jason and yeah wishing you just amazing things from here i appreciate you taking the time to tell your story i know it will mean a lot to people to hear it it's always great to see that hope on the other side and that you can turn things around quite quickly sometimes sounds like yours is you know i always say radical success is the exception not the norm so you know don't want people watching to feel discouraged if their recovery doesn't happen in two weeks i know overall it took longer than that a few months for you guys yeah it is just really encouraging to see that you can turn things around and sometimes really quite quickly so yeah thank you so much for doing this today i really appreciate it kelly yeah thank you for those of you watching looking forward to your comments as always and i will link up here if you're interested in learning more about jason mctiernan and his program i can thrive we'll put a video here to help you get a better sense of what that's all about so yeah thank you again kelly thank you to those of you watching i hope you enjoyed this video i hope you got something out of it and i hope to see you in this next one here\n\nSPEAKER_01:

struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great

for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":67.95150550372156,"bm25_ratio":3.021821472754659,"global_start":2520,"global_end":2820,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.6026844788185347,"llm_explanation":null,"llm_is_contained":null},{"quote":"had

u","source_doc_content":"SPEAKER_00: you guys i have such an incredible interview for you today this is a really special one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's

all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one

closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well

something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending

guys i have such an incredible interview for you today this is a really special one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around

share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":36.95235090251266,"bm25_ratio":1.0817779958005902,"global_start":3360,"global_end":3660,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.5044803307973491,"llm_explanation":null,"llm_is_contained":null},{"quote":"I

other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":26.891399176325272,"bm25_ratio":1.4621719433170588,"global_start":3694,"global_end":3721,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.6799475652334039,"llm_explanation":"Text 1 is

every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say

would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01:

but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that

guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points

doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or

which","source_doc_content":"SPEAKER_00: you guys i have such an incredible interview for you today this is a really special one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning

one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":26.073332062806962,"bm25_ratio":1.60838337657897,"global_start":4410,"global_end":4710,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.5545318579847731,"llm_explanation":"Text

to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":45.30776314050807,"bm25_ratio":1.7770264744040039,"global_start":4410,"global_end":4920,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.5151247609138354,"llm_explanation":null,"llm_is_contained":null},{"quote":"I've

if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy","source_doc_content":"SPEAKER_00: you guys i have such an incredible interview for you today this is a really special one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason

pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending

incredible interview for you today this is a really special one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now

interview for you today this is a really special one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for

lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":43.719779607589125,"bm25_ratio":1.3962510076749646,"global_start":8610,"global_end":8910,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.5675967357715421,"llm_explanation":null,"llm_is_contained":null},{"quote":"then

along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to

just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason

bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":31.68863645858381,"bm25_ratio":1.764712162358662,"global_start":13860,"global_end":14580,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.3493045767099371,"llm_explanation":null,"llm_is_contained":null},{"quote":"having

probl","source_doc_content":"SPEAKER_00: you guys i have such an incredible interview for you today this is a really special one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many

excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that

shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":25.89632341373015,"bm25_ratio":1.042646498336223,"global_start":16527,"global_end":16553,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.4889246543565685,"llm_explanation":"Text 1 is

am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that

have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get

the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":23.180204476592053,"bm25_ratio":2.0582753537950773,"global_start":17179,"global_end":17233,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.8355389866181382,"llm_explanation":null,"llm_is_contained":null},{"quote":"I'm

so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me

i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do

three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":84.96860119392488,"bm25_ratio":1.388212519503345,"global_start":10290,"global_end":10590,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.6308707288061901,"llm_explanation":null,"llm_is_contained":null},{"quote":"The

not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything

delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway

relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or decades it can start to feel pretty hopeless so seeing that people are recovering at all different stages after all different amounts of time different levels of severity i think just putting that information out there helps people have the hope they need to have that fuel to keep going because it's a tough journey for people watching of course everything if you want information about the program that irene used it will all be linked in the video description for jason mctiernan tiernan his program is called i can thrive and yeah just thank you again for people watching i'm sending massive hugs to you keep at it you have totally got this don't give up until you find your answers i hope irene is an incredible example of that so yeah thank you for watching\n","bm25_score":67.79906715228464,"bm25_ratio":1.1825842416847603,"global_start":13860,"global_end":14160,"match_ratio":1.0,"cosine_similarity":0.7515684229584938,"llm_explanation":null,"llm_is_contained":null},{"quote":"meditation

","source_doc_content":"SPEAKER_00: you guys i have such an incredible interview for you today this is a really special one this is not something that comes along every day or every week i am so excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked

yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do

excited to help share the incredible story of someone who was very unwell with mecfs for thirty three years at times severely unwell bed bound just really struggling and is now here today to share her full recovery story from mecfs i'm here with irene o'brien over in surrey in england and the story is so special to me personally because my mother was sick with mecfs for almost thirty years and i have a really good sense of what that looks like and how easy it can be to give up so i'm excited to see that once again we have so many examples that it's never too late no matter how severe no matter how sick no matter how long there is still hope and there are still ways out of this so please join me in welcoming the amazing irene irene so great to have you here today thank you so much for doing this thank\n\nSPEAKER_01: you very much for having me yeah you help anybody\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah so amazing that you are doing this today sharing your story and i know that you've persevered through people watching a solid half hour of technical problems that were my fault\n\nSPEAKER_00: this woman has so much patience clearly if you lived with cfs for so many years and didn't give up so you've had quite the journey with this so tell us about that\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah well it sort of came out of the blue obviously as it does for most people i was quite had a very active life you know sort of running around all over the place doing looking after three little children i did all sorts of extra activities you know i ran a youth group i ran a sunday school i did volunteer work at the school fundraising was in a bible study so burnt the candle at both ends i was i think i used to sleep from about two three o'clock in the morning and i'd be awake at five and just on the go but i had lots of energy so it didn't matter one day i just was driving home from school having done a fundraising thing and halfway up the hill i thought i don't know what's wrong with me i just can't go any further and i stopped at my friend's house and she said to her i just don't know what's wrong with me i'm i just can't do anything so she took me home and i was there for the next eighteen months was in bed i felt fine when i laid down and then i felt like i had energy and i think i'll go and bake a cake the minute i stood up i just couldn't do anything i just drained of energy completely so i was there for eighteen months and i was very lucky with the three children i had quite a support group lovely support group who fetched and carried and did everything for me had a lady that used to do the cooking and yeah so the children were well looked after and they used to come home in the afternoons and sit in the bed with me and would do homework things like that and then after the eighteen months well back in those days they just said well you've got yuppie flu as it was called\n\nSPEAKER_01: and all you need to do is exercise and eat well and that's fine but exercise was completely out of the question but after eighteen months of being in bed i did sort of recover slowly but never completely so i was able to live a fairly good life but always tired constantly tired so i mean that went on for many years then i came over the uk because i was in africa at that time and i came over to the uk with my daughter for the first couple of years it was fine but then i started overdoing things again i was walking like ten miles every day just to try and get exercise i picked up a couple of viruses because i was working in a care home and i picked up two viruses and i was on leave for a month at the end of the month i woke up at five in the morning to get ready to go to work and i just i just can't get out of bed i can't do this again i'm back to where i was in the beginning so i actually had to retire at that stage and then being retired again then i thought no i've got to keep up the exercise so i kept pushing myself pushing myself and then i moved and that was quite traumatic\n\nSPEAKER_01: and then i started again going on this sort of exercise thing i had to walk there's a place called box hill which is near us which is where they did the olympics cycling i took to walking up that if i couldn't do a long walk i would walk up the steps to the top it's about maybe i think it's two hundred meters or so the top ascent but yeah even when i was tired i wouldn't let myself not go i'd wake up in the morning at five o'clock and make sure my clothes my walking clothes were in the bathroom so as soon as i got up to go to the bathroom i put my clothes on grab my bag and i was gone before i'd had anything to drink or eat or anything i just went walking i'd be back by seven eight nine o'clock sometimes have a shower and of course i got to the stage where then i couldn't really do anything for myself you know so once i got back i just had to lie down because i couldn't i didn't have the energy to cook or anything else so it was okay but if i prepared my breakfast but if i hadn't then it was a problem then i would eat anything that i could just put hand to you know i put on a lot of weight which of course then exacerbates it because you get on like a treadmill and then one day when i walked i was going up box hill it was about six o'clock in the morning and i got to a certain place and i thought i don't sit down i'm going to fall down so i sat down on a tree trunk that was there and normally there were people walking up and down you know doing training for marathons i suppose they were running up and down there was nobody there that morning and i sort of sat there for a bit and i thought but i can't stay here as i'm sort of halfway up the hill well three quarters of the way up the hill if i don't go up i can't go down and i've got to go so i stood up and fell over i just collapsed but i got myself up eventually and went up to the top went down the hill and that was it went to the doctors and i said i just don't know what's wrong with me i mean i you know i knew i had me but i had shelved it i just wasn't going to have it and they just sort of said well no there's nothing much we can do for you and they sent me on a course with the nhs to try and get help and they did all the tests you know the usual tests and things that they did but they basically said look there's not much we can do you've got kind of learn to live with it you've got to just pace yourself do what you can\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i've never been one to actually accept that that's going to be the rest of my life because at that stage i wasn't able to do anything i mean showering was something that i did if i'd saved up two weeks worth of energy to go and have a shower if i had to share a shower and wash my hair then it was going to be another two weeks afterwards that i was not able to do anything so yeah it was very difficult at that stage and just before lockdown so that was what twenty was it twenty twenty one i suppose yeah i think we went into lockdown twenty twenty one a friend of mine had come over from south africa to help me just to see if there was anything they could manage to do and of course ended up being in lockdown with us with me\n\nSPEAKER_01: which was quite it was a blessing for me because then i had somebody do the cooking and the washing and everything else so they kind of took over and looked after me but i did get to the stage where i sort of thought okay i'm feeling better so i think i can do this but the moment i had to start doing my own cooking washing and everything else i was back to square one and you know couldn't really do much luckily i had all my groceries brought in because with lockdown we could do that we could have it delivered\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i used to watch a lot of your interviews that you used to give what you still do the interviews that you give and this friend of mine was looking watching and i got you know sort of i don't know whether i'm just lazy or whether it's just that i just didn't have the energy to actually do all the things that one's supposed to do to try and get better you know i'd read a few books as i get halfway through and then i just i just can't do that i try a different way of eating and then it would just be too much it's just everything was just too much and then i heard you jason and that i can thrive and you were talking about brain retraining rewiring your brain and my first reaction was oh no raylan no when do you start telling me it's all on my brain it's\n\nSPEAKER_01: and i was not impressed i thought no i'm going to find somebody else to watch because raylan's gone to the other side you know\n\nSPEAKER_01: to say it's all in your mind anyway then i saw another one of yours again with jason and i thought okay so what you're saying is it's not actually in your mind i think it was more jason saying not in your mind it is that your mind if you retrain your brain to think let me try and say that again\n\nSPEAKER_01: because your brain is stuck in that flight or flight mode and that's just because of having overdone things all the time your body is trying to protect you so your mind then would just shut down the moment you did something because it was scared you're going to overdo it if you know what i mean does that make sense\n\nSPEAKER_01: so you know when he when i heard him explaining all that that in fact your body has switched down some of the genes that you have and now you're stuck in this fight too much you know it just started making sense to me because quite a laid back sort of person always have been but i suddenly found myself stressing about silly things the doorbell rang for instance i would shoot through the roof you know just like i was a gibbering wreck that's stupid even if i was expecting the doorbell to ring it was just i was finding my shoulders creeping up what are you doing you know and i had to physically relax so that was\n\nSPEAKER_01: then i contacted jason and went onto his program because it actually really made sense and after chatting to him i think it's something i could do for quite a while i've been looking for something you know that i can do that i know i'll follow through and so it sort of clicked for me and then having done worked with him i found it really really helpful because i've never ever thought i'm not going to get better you know i've always thought i know i can i can get on top of it maybe not be healed from it that was something i had a problem with as well when people talked about being healed from it no i don't think you can be healed from it i think you can go into what do you call it remission yes remission that's it and i don't think you ever get healed from it i think my mindset's not changed and i think you can actually be healed from it yeah and in the process i mean i've learnt to listen to myself listen to my body i think that's so yes there's been a lifestyle change in a way i've had to it's been a journey of getting to know myself work out what my triggers are and i think that's that's been the biggest part for me is learning what i need to do to keep myself healthy instead of going back if that makes sense to you\n\nSPEAKER_00: it does yeah something i hear a lot of people say in interviews about their journey definitely seems to be a reoccurring theme with people i find it so interesting and amazing that you made it through all those years those hard years and still never gave up that belief that you were going to recover i'm sure you had days where you weren't like yes you probably had your down days but overall you held onto that and it would be very easy to get jaded and give up all hope after all of that time so do you have any idea what it was do you think that kept you in that\n\nSPEAKER_01: mindset i'm just a very positive person i think i'm also obstinate\n\nSPEAKER_01: you're not going to tell me how i'm going to be for the rest of my life\n\nSPEAKER_01: so i think part is just my personality is like that i never ever felt in fact i was almost like in denial so like you know i'd go to the doctor and say well i'm really struggling but you do know you have me don't you yes well i do but yeah well okay fine\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it was a lot of that is just not really accepting it i just i mean i knew i had it and i knew that it came with all that fatigue but part of it was probably just ignorance\n\nSPEAKER_01: be part of it\n\nSPEAKER_00: when you finally got onto this path where you were making progress you found what was kind of making sense for you how long did it take you from that point to get to a place where you're like yeah i think i'm pretty much fully here back\n\nSPEAKER_01: well it didn't take long it didn't take long at all i think like i was getting to the stage of my illness where i thought i'm not going to give into it but i am going to have to make life changes i can't carry on dreaming about the fact that one day i will be carrying going up box hill again and going out for walks in the forests and things like that my life is going to have to change from that point of view so i think that's sort of the closest i got to saying okay this is never going to happen but then working with jason it was quite soon as soon as i you know he he goes through like relaxation and then this is the other one well there's quite a few things that he goes through but then being positive you know trying to think what he would call it but that for me as i said was the easiest one because he said to me oh like we go through certain steps what would you like to go through today and i think he thought that that would be the hardest maybe for some people that is the hardest is just accepting that i am going to get better so i had no problem in believing that at all the problem i have is the one full relaxation i'm not good at relaxing i'm really really not good at relaxing so i've always found that a struggle you know people say do meditation and this meditation is something i just\n\nSPEAKER_01: i've always struggled with it so that sort of came into line though once i went through all that yeah i can do this i am confident that this is this is going to work this is a good thing and then the relaxation took a bit more work so i think once i once i've got into it probably about two weeks i could feel the difference\n\nSPEAKER_01: it was quite quick but it's been while longer that it's taken me to yeah to get back to knowing that i'm fine now i'm fine i still have my days when i'm tired get me wrong but then i know i've overdone it you know so i now can stop myself before i actually get to the stage where i'm really pushing pushing boundaries you know i mean the other day i thought i walked from here i walked about six kilometers to another little village caught the bus from there to another town and then when i was sitting waiting to come back on the bus i thought my bus is fifteen minutes time and this one is ten minutes i can go on this bus so i jumped on this bus it was going to take me to another place which was two and a half hours away from where i needed to be but it went through another village and i thought you know what i'm tired so i think i'm going to get off here because i can get home in half an hour otherwise if i carry on on this path\n\nSPEAKER_01: it's going to be another at least two hours before i get home so i was able to stop myself from that no i'm doing this because that's what i set up to do so you know i think it's things like that\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's really like the brain training continues even once you're in that recovery phase because all of those old habits and personality traits are there it's pretty ingrained it's you think it's just knowing that it's not good for you i was naive that's what i thought i'm like okay i've seen the light this isn't the way you're supposed to live i'm going to do better and then i thought i could just flick a switch and be a whole new person\n\nSPEAKER_00: and it's still something that i'm working on\n\nSPEAKER_01: i think you do it's something that you constantly having to be worked on because i think a lot of people with chronic fatigue are people pleasers yeah well you know i think that's quite a common theme so there's things i've had to put in place where you know like if my phone rings i let it go to voicemail if it's not you know if it's one of my children obviously i'm not going to do that but they might be watching\n\nSPEAKER_01: you guys just everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_01: i just did it go to voicemail because i can deal with it when i want to as that's something i'm not i know i'm not good at is when something comes up and people ask me to do something they don't expect you to do it now they'll say at some stage could you do this that doesn't work for me if you've given me something to do i want to do it get it done so now i do let my phone go to voicemail and i can just ignore it and eventually sort of pick it up later when i when i know i've got the time and i feel like doing something so it's yeah it's it's learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_01: the hardest for me was learning boundaries\n\nSPEAKER_00: boundaries with ourselves and with everybody else\n\nSPEAKER_00: when to get off the bus and call it a day and also want to put it to voicemail exactly yeah and i also think recognizing that you need rest for the rest of your life and your body will have limits even once you're well so you know i just so many people i talk to have interviewed have talked about this concept of like real rest like what so many of us think these days of as rest and when i'm like oh i'm a bit tired maybe i should sit down and watch tv for a bit or scroll instagram but that's not really rejuvenating so now i make myself every day lay down and take a nap or do some meditation and i actually smile and i say to myself in my head i'm like real rest and i'm just trying to kind of retrain that habit of like this is a good thing you healthy people do this\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i\n\nSPEAKER_01: think that is important i'm not good at resting i really am not as you say i'll sit there for a bit and then i think let me just see what's on my phone you know just\n\nSPEAKER_01: let me just check facebook\n\nSPEAKER_01: you really don't need to\n\nSPEAKER_01: being aware of the things that encroach in your life like the phones in the evenings i just leave mine in the lounge when i go to bed that i'm not in the morning when i'm awake and i feel like getting up then i can look at my phone\n\nSPEAKER_01: yeah it is it's training yourself all the time realizing what put you where you were and then going forward\n\nSPEAKER_00: what is your family or your friends people around you think of this you were unwell and struggling in various degrees sometimes really severely for a really long time do you tell them that you recovered through something called primarily brain retraining or what do they think what is those conversations look like\n\nSPEAKER_01: well i mean my my family have been very supportive obviously they've seen me at my worst they said to me i even look better you know they can't believe the difference and how much better i look obviously i'm able to do things i'm not sure if they really understand the brain retraining they well they were people in signs so this would like question things more but they can see the difference that it's made and they understand the whole thing behind it so they actually\n\nSPEAKER_01: people that don't really get it the people who never got the cfs in the first place you know the people who\n\nSPEAKER_01: mustn't isolate yourself no no no you're doing this all wrong because you're becoming a recluse and you just keeping yourself away from people because i would just stay in my flat obviously because i didn't have the energy to do anything else so they never understood it then they certainly don't understand it now\n\nSPEAKER_01: maybe if you had done more you would have got better quick because they didn't understand it in the first place\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i think there's just a certain level of acceptance that has to happen for all of us that just the majority of people as much as we want them to are just never going to get it what it is\n\nSPEAKER_01: that i do have to at the moment try and control my wouldn't say temper\n\nSPEAKER_01: i can flare up when people say silly things sometimes\n\nSPEAKER_01: why do i need to worry because i don't really care what people think to be honest i don't but then sometimes i will just flare up when somebody says something that clearly shows you don't understand\n\nSPEAKER_01: why are you even pretending to try and understand when you're not even you're not\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know and that's something i struggle with but i'll get\n\nSPEAKER_00: i think that's pretty normal i suspect virtually all of us have our limits where we're like okay my patience is gone my acceptance is gone\n\nSPEAKER_01: what's wrong with you\n\nSPEAKER_01: but yeah i'm not used to being to flaring up with things\n\nSPEAKER_01: but i think it's because i know i know what i've been through my family know what i've been through when somebody minimizes it you can think no\n\nSPEAKER_01: you know it is hard it is hard for anybody who's been through that gone through it\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it still gets me as well i obviously get a lot of comments and stuff and the majority of people are really positive and supportive but everyone get people they're like oh if you recovered and you were never sick and it still gets me i still have those trigger points like how dare you you don't know what i've been through it was a nightmare it was but it's just\n\nSPEAKER_00: i don't think we're ever going to escape it\n\nSPEAKER_01: you just have to let it go it doesn't matter\n\nSPEAKER_00: irene thank you so much it is so incredible that you took the time is very generous of you to do this with your time and energy and i know it's not an easy thing to do these sorts of things i know lots of people out there are going to really appreciate it so really genuinely thank you so much for doing this today irene this was incredible\n\nSPEAKER_01: well as i say thank you very much for letting me come talk to you because i hope it helps somebody you know\n\nSPEAKER_00: yeah i just there's so many people out there that have been struggling for years or
